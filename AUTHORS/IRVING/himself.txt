                                THE SKETCH BOOK
                        THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
                              by Washington Irving

  "I am of this mind with Homer, that as the snaile that crept out
of her shel was turned eftsoons into a toad, and thereby was forced to
make a stoole to sit on; so the traveller that stragleth from his owne
country is in a short time transformed into so monstrous a shape, that
he is faine to alter his mansion with his manners, and to live where
he can, not where he would."
                                                      LYLY'S EUPHUES.

  I WAS always fond of visiting new scenes, and observing strange
characters and manners. Even when a mere child I began my travels, and
made many tours of discovery into foreign parts and unknown regions of
my native city, to the frequent alarm of my parents, and the emolument
of the town-crier. As I grew into boyhood, I extended the range of
my observations. My holiday afternoons were spent in rambles about the
surrounding country. I made myself familiar with all its places famous
in history or fable. I knew every spot where a murder or robbery had
been committed, or a ghost seen. I visited the neighboring villages,
and added greatly to my stock of knowledge, by noting their habits and
customs, and conversing with their sages and great men. I even
journeyed one long summer's day to the summit of the most distant
hill, whence I stretched my eye over many a mile of terra incognita,
and was astonished to find how vast a globe I inhabited.
  This rambling propensity strengthened with my years. Books of
voyages and travels became my passion, and in devouring their
contents, I neglected the regular exercises of the school. How
wistfully would I wander about the pier-heads in fine weather, and
watch the parting ships, bound to distant climes- with what longing
eyes would I gaze after their lessening sails, and waft myself in
imagination to the ends of the earth!
  Further reading and thinking, though they brought this vague
inclination into more reasonable bounds, only served to make it more
decided. I visited various parts of my own country; and had I been
merely a lover of fine scenery, I should have felt little desire to
seek elsewhere its gratification, for on no country have the charms of
nature been more prodigally lavished. Her mighty lakes, like oceans of
liquid silver; her mountains, with their bright aerial tints; her
valleys, teeming with wild fertility; her tremendous cataracts,
thundering in their solitudes; her boundless plains, waving with
spontaneous verdure; her broad deep rivers, rolling in solemn
silence to the ocean; her trackless forests, where vegetation puts
forth all its magnificence; her skies, kindling with the magic of
summer clouds and glorious sunshine;- no, never need an American
look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural
scenery.
  But Europe held forth the charms of storied and poetical
association. There were to be seen the masterpieces of art, the
refinements of highly-cultivated society, the quaint peculiarities
of ancient and local custom. My native country was full of youthful
promise: Europe was rich in the accumulated treasures of age. Her very
ruins told the history of times gone by, and every mouldering stone
was a chronicle. I longed to wander over the scenes of renowned
achievement- to tread, as it were, in the footsteps of antiquity- to
loiter about the ruined castle- to meditate on the falling tower- to
escape, in short, from the commonplace realities of the present, and
lose myself among the shadowy grandeurs of the past.
  I had, beside all this, an earnest desire to see the great men of
the earth. We have, it is true, our great men in America: not a city
but has an ample share of them. I have mingled among them in my
time, and been almost withered by the shade into which they cast me;
for there is nothing so baleful to a small man as the shade of a great
one, particularly the great man of a city. But I was anxious to see
the great men of Europe; for I had read in the works of various
philosophers, that all animals degenerated in America, and man among
the number. A great man of Europe, thought I, must therefore be as
superior to a great man of America, as a peak of the Alps to a
highland of the Hudson; and in this idea I was confirmed, by observing
the comparative importance and swelling magnitude of many English
travellers among us, who, I was assured, were very little people in
their own country. I will visit this land of wonders, thought I, and
see the gigantic race from which I am degenerated.
  It has been either my good or evil lot to have my roving passion
gratified. I have wandered through different countries, and
witnessed many of the shifting scenes of life. I cannot say that I
have studied them with the eye of a philosopher; but rather with the
sauntering gaze with which humble lovers of the picturesque stroll
from the window of one print-shop to another; caught sometimes by
the delineations of beauty, sometimes by the distortions of
caricature, and sometimes by the loveliness of landscape. As it is the
fashion for modern tourists to travel pencil in hand, and bring home
their portfolios filled with sketches, I am disposed to get up a few
for the entertainment of my friends. When, however, I look over the
hints and memorandums I have taken down for the purpose, my heart
almost fails me at finding how my idle humor has led me aside from the
great objects studied by every regular traveller who would make a
book. I fear I shall give equal disappointment with an unlucky
landscape painter, who had travelled on the continent, but,
following the bent of his vagrant inclination, had sketched in
nooks, and corners, and by-places. His sketchbook was accordingly
crowded with cottages, and landscapes, and obscure ruins; but he had
neglected to paint St. Peter's, or the Coliseum; the cascade of Terni,
or the bay of Naples; and had not a single glacier or volcano in his
whole collection.

                        THE END
