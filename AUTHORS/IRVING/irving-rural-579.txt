                                 RURAL FUNERALS

                              by Washington Irving

         Here's a few flowers! but about midnight more:

         The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night;

         Are strewings fitt'st for graves-

         You were as flowers now wither'd; even so

         These herblets shall, which we upon you strow.

                                                   CYMBELINE.

  AMONG the beautiful and simple-hearted customs of rural life which
still linger in some parts of England, are those of strewing flowers
before the funerals, and planting them at the graves of departed
friends. These, it is said, are the remains of some of the rites of
the primitive church; but they are of still higher antiquity, having
been observed among the Greeks and Romans, and frequently mentioned by
their writers, and were, no doubt, the spontaneous tributes of
unlettered affection, originating long before art had tasked itself to
modulate sorrow into song, or story it on the monument. They are now
only to be met with in the most distant and retired places of the
kingdom, where fashion and innovation have not been able to throng in,
and trample out all the curious and interesting traces of the olden
time.

  In Glamorganshire, we are told, the bed whereon the corpse lies is
covered with flowers, a custom alluded to in one of the wild and
plaintive ditties of Ophelia:

             White his shroud as the mountain snow

               Larded all with sweet flowers;

             Which be-wept to the grave did go,

               With true love showers.

  There is also a most delicate and beautiful rite observed in some of
the remote villages of the south, at the funeral of a female who has
died young and unmarried. A chaplet of white flowers is borne before
the corpse by a young girl nearest in age, size, and resemblance,
and is afterwards hung up in the church over the accustomed seat of
the deceased. These chaplets are sometimes made of white paper, in
imitation of flowers, and inside of them is generally a pair of
white gloves. They are intended as emblems of the purity of the
deceased, and the crown of glory which she has received in heaven.

  In some parts of the country, also, the dead are carried to the
grave with the singing of psalms and hymns: a kind of triumph, "to
show," says Bourne, "that they have finished their course with joy,
and are become conquerors." This, I am informed, is observed in some
of the northern counties, particularly in Northumberland, and it has a
pleasing, though melancholy effect, to hear, of a still evening, in
some lonely country scene, the mournful melody of a funeral dirge
swelling from a distance, and to see the train slowly moving along the
landscape.

           Thus, thus, and thus, we compass round

           Thy harmlesse and unhaunted ground,

           And as we sing thy dirge, we will

                                    The daffodill

           And other flowers lay upon

           The altar of our love, thy stone.

                                          HERRICK.

There is also a solemn respect paid by the traveller to the passing
funeral in these sequestered places; for such spectacles, occurring
among the quiet abodes of nature, sink deep into the soul. As the
mourning train approaches, he pauses, uncovered, to let it go by; he
then follows silently in the rear; sometimes quite to the grave, at
other times for a few hundred yards, and, having paid this tribute
of respect to the deceased, turns and resumes his journey.

  The rich vein of melancholy which runs through the English
character, and gives it some of its most touching and ennobling
graces, is finely evidenced in these pathetic customs, and in the
solicitude shown by the common people for an honored and a peaceful
grave. The humblest peasant, whatever may be his lowly lot while
living, is anxious that some little respect may be paid to his
remains. Sir Thomas Overbury, describing the "faire and happy
milkmaid," observes, "thus lives she, and all her care is, that she
may die in the spring-time, to have store of flowers stucke upon her
windingsheet." The poets, too, who always breathe the feeling of a
nation, continually advert to this fond solicitude about the grave. In
"The Maid's Tragedy," by Beaumont and Fletcher, there is a beautiful
instance of the kind, describing the capricious melancholy of a
broken-hearted girl:

                                   When she sees a bank

         Stuck full of flowers, she, with a sigh, will tell

         Her servants, what a pretty place it were

         To bury lovers in; and make her maids

         Pluck 'em, and strew her over like a corse.

  The custom of decorating graves was once universally prevalent:
osiers were carefully bent over them to keep the turf uninjured, and
about them were planted evergreens and flowers. "We adorn their
graves," says Evelyn, in his Sylva, "with flowers and redolent plants,
just emblems of the life of man, which has been compared in Holy
Scriptures to those fading beauties, whose roots being buried in
dishonor, rise again in glory." This usage has now become extremely
rare in England; but it may still be met with in the church-yards of
retired villages, among the Welsh mountains; and I recollect an
instance of it at the small town of Ruthen, which lies at the head
of the beautiful vale of Clewyd. I have been told also by a friend,
who was present at the funeral of a young girl in Glamorganshire, that
the female attendants had their aprons full of flowers, which, as soon
as the body was interred, they stuck about the grave.

  He noticed several graves which had been decorated in the same
manner. As the flowers had been merely stuck in the ground, and not
planted, they had soon withered, and might be seen in various states
of decay; some drooping, others quite perished. They were afterwards
to be supplanted by holly, rosemary, and other evergreens; which on
some graves had grown to great luxuriance, and overshadowed the
tombstones.

  There was formerly a melancholy fancifulness in the arrangement of
these rustic offerings, that had something in it truly poetical. The
rose was sometimes blended with the lily, to form a general emblem
of frail mortality. "This sweet flower," said Evelyn, "borne on a
branch set with thorns, and accompanied with the lily, are natural
hieroglyphics of our fugitive, umbratile, anxious, and transitory
life, which, making so fair a show for a time, is not yet without
its thorns and crosses." The nature and color of the flowers, and of
the ribbons with which they were tied, had often a particular
reference to the qualities or story of the deceased, or were
expressive of the feelings of the mourner. In an old poem, entitled
"Corydon's Doleful Knell," a lover specifies the decorations he
intends to use:

             A garland shall be framed

               By art and nature's skill,

             Of sundry-colored flowers,

               In token of good-will.

             And sundry-color'd ribands

               On it I will bestow;

             But chiefly blacke and yellowe

               With her to grave shall go.

             I'll deck her tomb with flowers,

               The rarest ever seen;

             And with my tears as showers,

               I'll keep them fresh and green.

  The white rose, we are told, was planted at the grave of a virgin;
her chaplet was tied with white ribbons, in token of her spotless
innocence; though sometimes black ribbons were intermingled, to
bespeak the grief of the survivors. The red rose was occasionally used
in remembrance of such as had been remarkable for benevolence; but
roses in general were appropriated to the graves of lovers. Evelyn
tells us that the custom was not altogether extinct in his time,
near his dwelling in the county of Surrey, "where the maidens yearly
planted and decked the graves of their defunct sweethearts with
rose-bushes." And Camden likewise remarks, in his Britannia: "Here
is also a certain custom, observed time out of mind, of planting
rose-trees upon the graves, especially by the young men and maids
who have lost their loves; so that this church-yard is now full of
them."

  When the deceased had been unhappy in their loves, emblems of a more
gloomy character were used, such as the yew and cypress; and if
flowers were strewn, they were of the most melancholy colors. Thus, in
poems by Thomas Stanley, Esq. (published in 1651), is the following
stanza:

                                 Yet strew

             Upon my dismall grave

             Such offerings as you have,

             Forsaken cypresse and sad yewe;

             For kinder flowers can take no birth

             Or growth from such unhappy earth.

  In "The Maid's Tragedy," a pathetic little air is introduced,
illustrative of this mode of decorating the funerals of females who
had been disappointed in love:

             Lay a garland on my hearse,

               Of the dismall yew,

             Maidens, willow branches wear,

               Say I died true.

             My love was false, but I was firm,

               From my hour of birth,

             Upon my buried body lie

               Lightly, gentle earth.

  The natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and
elevate the mind; and we have a proof of it in the purity of sentiment
and unaffected elegance of thought which pervaded the whole of these
funeral observances. Thus, it was an especial precaution that none but
sweet-scented evergreens and flowers should be employed. The intention
seems to have been to soften the horrors of the tomb, to beguile the
mind from brooding over the disgraces of perishing mortality, and to
associate the memory of the deceased with the most delicate and
beautiful objects in nature. There is a dismal process going on in the
grave, ere dust can return to its kindred dust, which the
imagination shrinks from contemplating; and we seek still to think
of the form we have loved, with those refined associations which it
awakened when blooming before us in youth and beauty. "Lay her i'
the earth," says Laertes, of his virgin sister,

           And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

           May violets spring!

  Herrick, also, in his "Dirge of Jephtha," pours forth a fragrant
flow of poetical thought and image, which in a manner embalms the dead
in the recollections of the living.

         Sleep in thy peace, thy bed of spice,

         And make this place all Paradise:

         May sweets grow here! and smoke from hence

                                Fat frankincense.

         Let balme and cassia send their scent

         From out thy maiden monument.

         *      *      *      *      *      *

         May all shie maids at wonted hours

         Come forth to strew thy tombe with flowers!

         May virgins, when they come to mourn,

                                 Male incense burn

         Upon thine altar! then return

         And leave thee sleeping in thine urn.

  I might crowd my pages with extracts from the older British poets
who wrote when these rites were more prevalent, and delighted
frequently to allude to them; but I have already quoted more than is
necessary. I cannot however refrain from giving a passage from
Shakespeare, even though it should appear trite; which illustrates the
emblematical meaning often conveyed in these floral tributes; and at
the same time possesses that magic of language and appositeness of
imagery for which he stands pre-eminent.

                               With fairest flowers,

       Whilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,

       I'll sweeten thy sad grave; thou shalt not lack

       The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor

       The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor

       The leaf of eglantine; whom not to slander,

       Outsweeten'd not thy breath.

  There is certainly something more affecting in these prompt and
spontaneous offerings of nature, than in the most costly monuments
of art; the hand strews the flower while the heart is warm, and the
tear falls on the grave as affection is binding the osier round the
sod; but pathos expires under the slow labor of the chisel, and is
chilled among the cold conceits of sculptured marble.

  It is greatly to be regretted, that a custom so truly elegant and
touching has disappeared from general use, and exists only in the most
remote and insignificant villages. But it seems as if poetical
custom always shuns the walks of cultivated society. In proportion
as people grow polite they cease to be poetical. They talk of
poetry, but they have learnt to check its free impulses, to distrust
its sallying emotions, and to supply its most affecting and
picturesque usages, by studied form and pompous ceremonial. Few
pageants can be more stately and frigid than an English funeral in
town. It is made up of show and gloomy parade; mourning carriages,
mourning horses, mourning plumes, and hireling mourners, who make a
mockery of grief. "There is a grave digged," says Jeremy Taylor,
"and a solemn mourning, and a great talk in the neighborhood, and when
the daies are finished, they shall be, and they shall be remembered no
more." The associate in the gay and crowded city is soon forgotten;
the hurrying succession of new intimates and new pleasures effaces him
from our minds, and the very scenes and circles in which he moved
are incessantly fluctuating. But funerals in the country are
solemnly impressive. The stroke of death makes a wider space in the
village circle, and is an awful event in the tranquil uniformity of
rural life. The passing bell tolls its knell in every ear; it steals
with its pervading melancholy over hill and vale, and saddens all
the landscape.

  The fixed and unchanging features of the country also perpetuate the
memory of the friend with whom we once enjoyed them; who was the
companion of our most retired walks, and gave animation to every
lonely scene. His idea is associated with every charm of nature; we
hear his voice in the echo which he once delighted to awaken; his
spirit haunts the grove which he once frequented; we think of him in
the wild upland solitude, or amidst the pensive beauty of the
valley. In the freshness of joyous morning, we remember his beaming
smiles and bounding gayety; and when sober evening returns with its
gathering shadows and subduing quiet, we call to mind many a
twilight hour of gentle talk and sweet-souled melancholy.

             Each lonely place shall him restore,

               For him the tear be duly shed;

             Beloved, till life can charm no more;

               And mourn'd till pity's self be dead.

  Another cause that perpetuates the memory of the deceased in the
country is that the grave is more immediately in sight of the
survivors. They pass it on their way to prayer, it meets their eyes
when their hearts are softened by the exercises of devotion; they
linger about it on the Sabbath, when the mind is disengaged from
worldly cares, and most disposed to turn aside from present
pleasures and present loves, and to sit down among the solemn mementos
of the past. In North Wales the peasantry kneel and pray over the
graves of their deceased friends, for several Sundays after the
interment; and where the tender rite of strewing and planting
flowers is still practised, it is always renewed on Easter,
Whitsuntide, and other festivals, when the season brings the companion
of former festivity more vividly to mind. It is also invariably
performed by the nearest relatives and friends; no menials nor
hirelings are employed; and if a neighbor yields assistance, it
would be deemed an insult to offer compensation.

  I have dwelt upon this beautiful rural custom, because, as it is one
of the last, so is it one of the holiest offices of love. The grave is
the ordeal of true affection. It is there that the divine passion of
the soul manifests its superiority to the instinctive impulse of
mere animal attachment. The latter must be continually refreshed and
kept alive by the presence of its object; but the love that is
seated in the soul can live on long remembrance. The mere inclinations
of sense languish and decline with the charms which excited them,
and turn with shuddering disgust from the dismal precincts of the
tomb; but it is thence that truly spiritual affection rises,
purified from every sensual desire, and returns, like a holy flame, to
illumine and sanctify the heart of the survivor.

  The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to
be divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal- every other affliction
to forget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open- this
affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude. Where is the
mother who would willingly forget the infant that perished like a
blossom from her arms, though every recollection is a pang? Where is
the child that would willingly forget the most tender of parents,
though to remember be but to lament? Who, even in the hour of agony,
would forget the friend over whom he mourns? Who, even when the tomb
is closing upon the remains of her he most loved; when he feels his
heart, as it were, crushed in the closing of its portal; would
accept of consolation that must be bought by forgetfulness?- No, the
love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of the
soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its delights; and when the
overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of
recollection; when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over
the present ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into
pensive meditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness-
who would root out such a sorrow from the heart? Though it may
sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety, or
spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom, yet who would exchange
it even for the song of pleasure, or the burst of revelry? No, there
is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song. There is a remembrance
of the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the living. Oh,
the grave!- the grave!- It buries every error- covers every defect-
extinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but
fond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the
grave even of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb, that he
should ever have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies
mouldering before him.

  But the grave of those we loved- what a place for meditation!
There it is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue
and gentleness, and the thousand endearments lavished upon us almost
unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy- there it is that we
dwell upon the tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting
scene. The bed of death, with all its stifled griefs- its noiseless
attendance- its mute, watchful assiduities. The last testimonies of
expiring love! The feeble, fluttering, thrilling- oh! how
thrilling!- pressure of the hand! The faint, faltering accents,
struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection! The
last fond look of the glazing eye, turned upon us even from the
threshold of existence!

  Ay, go to the grave of buried love, and meditate! There settle the
account with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited every
past endearment unregarded, of that departed being, who can never-
never- never return to be soothed by thy contrition!

  If thou art a child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or
a furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent- if thou art a
husband, and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole
happiness in thy arms to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy
truth- if thou art a friend, and hast ever wronged, in thought, or
word, or deed, the spirit that generously confided in thee- if thou
art a lover, and hast ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart
which now lies cold and still beneath thy feet;- then be sure that
every unkind look, every ungracious word, every ungentle action,
will come thronging back upon thy memory, and knocking dolefully at
thy soul- then be sure that thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant
on the grave, and utter the unheard groan, and pour the unavailing
tear; more deep, more bitter, because unheard and unavailing.

  Then weave thy chaplet of flowers, and strew the beauties of
nature about the grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with
these tender, yet futile tributes of regret; but take warning by the
bitterness of this thy contrite affliction over the dead, and
henceforth be more faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy
duties to the living.

  In writing the preceding article, it was not intended to give a full
detail of the funeral customs of the English peasantry, but merely
to furnish a few hints and quotations illustrative of particular
rites, to be appended, by way of note, to another paper, which has
been withheld. The article swelled insensibly into its present form,
and this is mentioned as an apology for so brief and casual a notice
of these usages, after they have been amply and learnedly investigated
in other works.

  I must observe, also, that I am well aware that this custom of
adorning graves with flowers prevails in other countries besides
England. Indeed, in some it is much more general, and is observed even
by the rich and fashionable; but it is then apt to lose its
simplicity, and to degenerate into affectation. Bright, in his travels
in Lower Hungary, tells of monuments of marble, and recesses formed
for retirement, with seats placed among bowers of greenhouse plants;
and that the graves generally are covered with the gayest flowers of
the season. He gives a casual picture of filial piety, which I
cannot but transcribe; for I trust it is as useful as it is
delightful, to illustrate the amiable virtues of the sex. "When I
was at Berlin," says he, "I followed the celebrated Iffland to the
grave. Mingled with some pomp, you might trace much real feeling. In
the midst of the ceremony, my attention was attracted by a young
woman, who stood on a mound of earth, newly covered with turf, which
she anxiously protected from the feet of the passing crowd. It was the
tomb of her parent; and the figure of this affectionate daughter
presented a monument more striking than the most costly work of art."

  I will barely add an instance of sepulchral decoration that I once
met with among the mountains of Switzerland. It was at the village
of Gersau, which stands on the borders of the Lake of Lucerne, at
the foot of Mount Rigi. It was once the capital of a miniature
republic, shut up between the Alps and the Lake, and accessible on the
land side only by foot-paths. The whole force of the republic did
not exceed six hundred fighting men; and a few miles of circumference,
scooped out as it were from the bosom of the mountains, comprised
its territory. The village of Gersau seemed separated from the rest of
the world, and retained the golden simplicity of a purer age. It had a
small church, with a burying-ground adjoining. At the heads of the
graves were placed crosses of wood or iron. On some were affixed
miniatures, rudely executed, but evidently attempts at likenesses of
the deceased. On the crosses were hung chaplets of flowers, some
withering, others fresh, as if occasionally renewed. I paused with
interest at this scene; I felt that I was at the source of poetical
description, for these were the beautiful but unaffected offerings
of the heart which poets are fain to record. In a gayer and more
populous place, I should have suspected them to have been suggested by
factitious sentiment, derived from books; but the good people of
Gersau knew little of books; there was not a novel nor a love poem
in the village; and I question whether any peasant of the place
dreamt, while he was twining a fresh chaplet for the grave of his
mistress, that he was fulfilling one of the most fanciful rites of
poetical devotion, and that he was practically a poet.

                        THE END
.
