                              A SUNDAY IN LONDON*

                              by Washington Irving

  * Part of a sketch omitted in the previous editions.

  IN A preceding paper I have spoken of an English Sunday in the
country, and its tranquillizing effect upon the landscape; but where
is its sacred influence more strikingly apparent than in the very
heart of that great Babel, London? On this sacred day, the gigantic
monster is charmed into repose. The intolerable din and struggle of
the week are at an end. The shops are shut. The fires of forges and
manufactories are extinguished; and the sun, no longer obscured by
murky clouds of smoke, pours down a sober, yellow radiance into the
quiet streets. The few pedestrians we meet, instead of hurrying
forward with anxious countenances, move leisurely along; their brows
are smoothed from the wrinkles of business and care; they have put
on their Sunday looks, and Sunday manners, with their Sunday
clothes, and are cleansed in mind as well as in person.

  And now the melodious clangor of bells from church towers summons
their several flocks to the fold. Forth issues from his mansion the
family of the decent tradesman, the small children in the advance;
then the citizen and his comely spouse, followed by the grown-up
daughters, with small morocco-bound prayer-books laid in the folds
of their pocket-handkerchiefs. The housemaid looks after them from the
window, admiring the finery of the family, and receiving, perhaps, a
nod and smile from her young mistresses, at whose toilet she has
assisted.

  Now rumbles along the carriage of some magnate of the city,
peradventure an alderman or a sheriff; and now the patter of many feet
announces a procession of charity scholars, in uniforms of antique
cut, and each with a prayer-book under his arm.

  The ringing of bells is at an end; the rumbling of the carriage
has ceased; the pattering of feet is heard no more; the flocks are
folded in ancient churches, cramped up in by-lanes and corners of
the crowded city, where the vigilant beadle keeps watch, like the
shepherd's dog, round the threshold of the sanctuary. For a time every
thing is hushed; but soon is heard the deep, pervading sound of the
organ, rolling and vibrating through the empty lanes and courts; and
the sweet chanting of the choir making them resound with melody and
praise. Never have I been more sensible of the sanctifying effect of
church music, than when I have heard it thus poured forth, like a
river of joy, through the inmost recesses of this great metropolis,
elevating it, as it were, from all the sordid pollutions of the
week; and bearing the poor world-worn soul on a tide of triumphant
harmony to heaven.

  The morning service is at an end. The streets are again alive with
the congregations returning to their homes, but soon again relapse
into silence. Now comes on the Sunday dinner, which, to the city
tradesman, is a meal of some importance. There is more leisure for
social enjoyment at the board. Members of the family can now gather
together, who are separated by the laborious occupations of the
week. A school-boy may be permitted on that day to come to the
paternal home; an old friend of the family takes his accustomed Sunday
seat at the board, tells over his well-known stories, and rejoices
young and old with his well-known jokes.

  On Sunday afternoon the city pours forth its legions to breathe
the fresh air and enjoy the sunshine of the parks and rural
environs. Satirists may say what they please about the rural
enjoyments of a London citizen on Sunday, but to me there is something
delightful in beholding the poor prisoner of the crowded and dusty
city enabled thus to come forth once a week and throw himself upon the
green bosom of nature. He is like a child restored to the mother's
breast; and they who first spread out these noble parks and
magnificent pleasure-grounds which surround this huge metropolis, have
done at least as much for its health and morality, as if they had
expended the amount of cost in hospitals, prisons, and penitentiaries.

                        THE END
