              ON THE LORD GEN. FAIRFAX AT THE SEIGE OF COLCHESTER
                                 by John Milton

      Fairfax, whose name in armes through Europe rings
        Filling each mouth with envy, or with praise,
        And all her jealous monarchs with amaze,
        And rumors loud, that daunt remotest kings,
      Thy firm unshak'n vertue ever brings
        Victory home, though new rebellions raise
        Thir Hydra heads, & the fals North displaies
        Her brok'n league, to impe their serpent wings,
      O yet a nobler task awaites thy hand;
        For what can Warr, but endless warr still breed,
        Till Truth, & Right from Violence be freed,
      And Public Faith cleard from the shamefull brand
        Of Public Fraud. In vain doth Valour bleed
        While Avarice, & Rapine share the land.

                        -THE END-
.
