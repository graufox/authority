           ON THE NEW FORCERS OF CONSCIENCE UNDER THE LONG PARLIAMENT
                                 by John Milton
     On the new forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament

      Because you have thrown of your Prelate Lord,
        And with stiff Vowes renounc'd his Liturgie
        To seise the widdow'd whore Pluralitie
        From them whose sin ye envi'd, not abhor'd,
      Dare ye for this adjure the Civill Sword
        To force our Consciences that Christ set free,
        And ride us with a classic Hierarchy
        Taught ye by meer A. S. and Rotherford?
      Men whose Life, Learning, Faith and pure intent
        Would have been held in high esteem with Paul
        Must now be nam'd and printed Hereticks
      By shallow Edwards and Scotch what d'ye call:
        But we do hope to find out all your tricks,
        Your plots and packing wors then those of Trent,
                                That so the Parliament
        May with their wholsom and preventive Shears
        Clip your Phylacteries, though bauk your Ears,
                                And succour our just Fears
        When they shall read this clearly in your charge
        New Presbyter is but Old Priest writ Large.

                          -THE END-
