                           A PARAPHRASE ON PSALM 114
                                 by John Milton
  This and the following Psalm were don by the Author at fifteen yeers
old.

  When the blest seed of Terah's faithfull Son,
  After long toil their liberty had won,
  And past from Pharian fields to Canaan Land,
  Led by the strength of the Almighties hand,
  Jehovah's wonders were in Israel shown,
  His praise and glory was in Israel known.
  That saw the troubl'd Sea, and shivering fled,
  And sought to hide his froth-becurled head
  Low in the earth, Jordans clear streams recoil,
  As a faint host that hath receiv'd the foil.
  The high, huge-bellied Mountains skip like Rams
  Amongst their Ews, the little Hills like Lambs.
  Why fled the Ocean? And why skipt the Mountains?
  Why turned Jordan toward his Crystall Fountains?
  Shake earth, and at the presence be agast
  Of him that ever was, and ay shall last,
  That glassy flouds from rugged rocks can crush,
  And make soft rills from fiery flint-stones gush.

                    -THE END-
