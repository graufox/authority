                                   PSALM 136
                                 by John Milton

  Let us with a gladsom mind
  Praise the Lord, for he is kind,
    For his mercies ay endure,
    Ever faithfull, ever sure.

  Let us blaze his Name abroad,
  For of gods he is the God;
    For, &c.

  O let us his praises tell,
  That doth the wrathfull tyrants quell.
    For, &c.

  That with his miracles doth make
  Amazed Heav'n and Earth to shake.
    For, &c.

  That by his wisdom did create
  The painted Heav'ns so full of state.
    For, &c.

  That did the solid Earth ordain
  To rise above the watry plain.
    For, &c.

  That by his all-commanding might,
  Did fill the new-made world with light.
    For, &c.

  And caus'd the Golden-tressed Sun,
  All the day long his cours to run.
    For, &c.

  The horned Moon to shine by night,
  Amongst her spangled sisters bright.
    For, &c.

  He with his thunder-clasping hand,
  Smote the first-born of Egypt Land.
    For, &c.

  And in despight of Pharao fell,
  He brought from thence his Israel.
    For, &c.

  The ruddy waves he cleft in twain,
  Of the Erythraean main.
    For, &c.

  The floods stood still like Walls of Glass,
  While the Hebrew Bands did pass.
    For, &c.

  But full soon they did devour
  The Tawny King with all his power.
    For, &c.

  His chosen people he did bless
  In the wastfull Wildernes.
    For, &c.

  In bloody battail he brought down
  Kings of prowess and renown.
    For, &c.

  He foild bold Seon and his host,
  That rul'd the Amorrean coast.
    For, &c.

  And large-lim'd Og he did subdue,
  With all his over hardy crew.
    For, &c.

  And to his Servant Israel,
  He gave their Land therin to dwell.
    For, &c.

  He hath with a piteous eye
  Beheld us in our misery.
  For, &c.

  And freed us from the slavery
  Of the invading enimy.
    For, &c.

  All living creatures he doth feed,
  And with full hand supplies their need.
    For, &c.

  Let us therfore warble forth
  His mighty Majesty and worth.
    For, &c.

  That his mansion hath on high
  Above the reach of mortall ey.
    For his mercies ay endure,
    Ever faithfull, ever sure.

            -THE END-
