                                 by John Milton
           Psalm I Done into Verse, 1653

  Bless'd is the man who hath not walk'd astray
  In counsel of the wicked, and ith' way
  Of sinners hath not stood, and in the seat
  Of scorners hath not sate. But in the great
  Jehovahs Law is ever his delight,
  And in his Law he studies day and night.
  He shall be as a tree which planted grows
  By watry streams, and in his season knows
  To yield his fruit, and his leaf shall not fall,
  And what he takes in hand shall prosper all.
  Not so the wicked, but as chaff which fann'd
  The wind drives, so the wicked shall not stand
  In judgment, or abide their tryal then,
  Nor sinners in th' assembly of just men.
  For the Lord knows th' upright way of the just,
  And the way of bad men to ruine must.

        Psalm II Done Aug.8.1653 Terzetti

  WHY do the Gentiles tumult, and the Nations
    Muse a vain thing, the Kings of th' earth upstand
    With power, and Princes in their Congregations
  Lay deep their plots together through each Land,
    Against the Lord and his Messiah dear.
    Let us break off, say they, by strength of hand
  Their bonds, and cast from us, no more to wear,
    Their twisted cords: he who in Heaven doth dwell
    Shall laugh, the Lord shall scoff them, then severe
  Speak to them in his wrath, and in his fell
    And fierce ire trouble them; but I saith hee
    Anointed have my King (though ye rebell)
  On Sion my holi' hill. A firm decree
    I will declare; the Lord to me hath say'd
    Thou art my Son I have begotten thee
  This day; ask of me, and the grant is made;
    As thy possession I on thee bestow
    Th' Heathen, and as thy conquest to be sway'd
  Earths utmost bounds: them shalt thou bring full low
    With Iron Scepter bruis'd, and them disperse
    Like to a potters vessel shiver'd so.
  And now be wise at length ye Kings averse
    Be taught ye Judges of the earth; with fear
    Jehovah serve, and let your joy converse
  With trembling; kiss the Son least he appear
    In anger and ye perish in the way
    If once his wrath take fire like fuel sere.
  Happy all those who have in him their stay.

         Psalm III Aug.9,1653
       When he fled from Absalom

  Lord how many are my foes
    How many those
  That in arms against me rise
    Many are they
    That of my life distrustfully thus say,
  No help for him in God there lies.
  But thou Lord art my shield my glory,
      Thee through my story
      Th' exalter of my head I count
           Aloud I cry'd
    Unto Jehovah, he full soon reply'd
  And heard me from his holy mount.
  I lay and slept, I wak'd again,
      For my sustain
    Was the Lord. Of many millions
      The populous rout
    I fear not though incamping round about
  They pitch against me their Pavillions.
  Rise Lord, save me my God for thou
      Hast smote ere now
    On the cheek-bone all my foes,
      Of men abhor'd
    Hast broke the teeth. This help was from the Lord;
  Thy blessing on thy people flows.

        Psalm IV Aug.10, 1653

  Answer me when I call
  God of my righteousness;
  In straights and in distres
  Thou didst me disinthrall
  And set at large; now spare,
    Now pity me, and hear my earnest prai'r.
  Great ones how long will ye
  My glory have in scorn
  How long be thus forborn
  Still to love vanity,
  To love, to seek, to prize
    Things false and vain and nothing else but lies?
  Yet know the Lord hath chose
  Chose to himself a part
  The good and meek of heart
  (For whom to chuse he knows)
  Jehovah from on high
    Will hear my voyce what time to him I crie.
  Be aw'd, and do not sin,
  Speak to your hearts alone,
  Upon your beds, each one,
  And be at peace within.
  Offer the offerings just
    Of righteousness and in Jehovah trust.
  Many there be that say
  Who yet will shew us good?
  Talking like this worlds brood
  But Lord, thus let me pray,
  On us lift up the light
    Lift up the favour of thy count'nance bright.
  Into my heart more joy
  And gladness thou hast put
  Then when a year of glut
  Their stores doth over-cloy
  And from their plenteous grounds
    With vast increase their corn and wine abounds.
  In peace at once will I
  Both lay me down and sleep
  For thou alone dost keep
  Me safe where ere I lie
  As in a rocky Cell
    Thou Lord alone in safety mak'st me dwell.

        Psalm V. Aug. 12, 1653

  Jehovah my words give ear
      My meditation waigh
    The voyce of my complaining hear
  My King and God for unto thee I pray.
    Jehovah thou my early voyce
      Shalt in the morning hear
    Ith' morning I to thee with choyce
  Will rank my Prayers, and watch till thou appear.
    For thou art not a God that takes
      In wickedness delight
    Evil with thee no biding makes
  Fools or mad men stand not within thy sight.
    All workers of iniquity
      Thou hat'st; and them unblest
    Thou wilt destroy that speak a ly
  The bloodi' and guileful man God doth detest.
    But I will in thy mercies dear
      Thy numerous mercies go
    Into thy house; I in thy fear
  Will towards thy holy temple worship low.
    Lord lead me in thy righteousness
      Lead me because of those
    That do observe if I transgress,
  Set thy wayes right before, where my step goes.
    For in his faltring mouth unstable
      No word is firm or sooth
    Their inside, troubles miserable;
  An open grave their throat, their tongue they smooth.
    God, find them guilty, let them fall
      By their own counsels quell'd;
    Push them in their rebellions all
  Still on; for against thee they have rebell'd;
    Then all who trust in thee shall bring
      Their joy, while thou from blame
    Defend'st them, they shall ever sing
  And shall triumph in thee, who love thy name.
    For thou Jehovah wilt be found
      To bless the just man still,
    As with a shield thou wilt surround
  Him with thy lasting favour and good will.

          Psalm VI Aug.13, 1653

  Lord in thine anger do not reprehend me
    Nor in thy hot displeasure me correct;
  Pity me Lord for I am much deject
    Am very weak and faint; heal and amend me,
  For all my bones, that even with anguish ake,
    Are troubled, yea my soul is troubled sore;
  And thou O Lord how long? turn Lord, restore
    My soul, O save me for thy goodness sake
  For in death no remembrance is of thee;
    Who in the grave can celebrate thy praise?
  Wearied I am with sighing out my dayes,
    Nightly my Couch I make a kind of Sea;
  My Bed I water with my tears; mine Eie
    Through grief consumes. is waxen old and dark
  Ith' mid'st of all mine enemies that mark.
    Depart all ye that work iniquitie.
  Depart from me, for the voice of my weeping
    The Lord hath heard, the Lord hath heard my prai'r
  My supplication with acceptance fair
    The Lord will own, and have me in his keeping.
  Mine enemies shall all be blank and dash't
    With much confusion; then grow red with shame,
  They shall return in hast the way they came
    And in a moment shall be quite abash't.

          Psalm VII Aug.14, 1653
  Upon the words of Chush the Benjamite against him

  Lord my God to thee I flie
  Save me and secure me under
  Thy protection while I crie
  Least as a Lion (and no wonder)
  He hast to tear my Soul asunder
  Tearing and no rescue nigh.

  Lord my God if I have thought
  Or done this, if wickedness
  Be in my hands, if I have wrought
  Ill to him that meant me peace,
  Or to him have render'd less,
  And not fre'd my foe for naught;

  Let th' enemy pursue my soul
  And overtake it, let him tread
  My life down to the earth and roul
  In the dust my glory dead,
  In the dust and there out spread
  Lodge it with dishonour foul.

  Rise Jehovah in thine ire
  Rouze thy self amidst the rage
  Of my foes that urge like fire;
  And wake for me, their furi' asswage;
  Judgment here thou didst ingage
  And command which I desire.

  So th' assemblies of each Nation
  Will surround thee, seeking right,
  Thence to thy glorious habitation
  Return on high and in their sight.
  Jehovah judgeth most upright
  All people from the foundation.

  Judge me Lord, be judge in this
  According to my righteousness
  And the innocence which is
  Upon me: cause at length to cease
  Of evil men the wickedness
  And their power that do amiss.

  But the just establish fast,
  Since thou art the just God that tries
  Hearts and reins. On God is cast
  My defence, and in him lies
  In him who both just and wise
  Saves th' upright of Heart at last.

  God is a just Judge and severe,
  And God is every day offended;
  If th' unj ust will not forbear,
  His Sword he whets, his Bow hath bended
  Already, and for him intended
  The tools of death, that waits him near.

  (His arrows purposely made he
  For them that persecute.) Behold
  He travels big with vanitie,
  Trouble he hath conceav'd of old
  As in a womb, and from that mould
  Hath at length brought forth a Lie.

  He dig'd a pit, and delv'd it deep,
  And fell into the pit he made,
  His mischief that due course doth keep
  Turns on his head, and his ill trade
  Of violence will undelay'd
  Fall on his crown with ruine steep.

  Then will I Jehovah's praise
  According to his justice raise
  And sing the Name and Deitie
  Of Jehovah the most high.

        Psalm VIII Aug.14.I653

  O Jehovah Lord how wondrous great
   And glorious is thy name through all the earth?
  So as above the Heavens thy praise to set
   Out of the tender mouths of latest hearth,

  Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou
   Hast founded strength because of all thy foes
  To stint th' enemy, and slack th' avengers brow
   That bends his rage thy providence to oppose.

  When I behold thy Heavens, thy Fingers art,
    The Moon and Starrs which thou so bright hast set,
  In the pure firmament, then saith my heart,
    O what is man that thou remembrest yet,

  And think'st upon him; or of man begot
    That him thou visit'st and of him art found;
  Scarce to be less then Gods, thou mad'st his lot,
    With honour and with state thou hast him crown'd.

  O're the works of thy hand thou mad'st him Lord,
    Thou hast put all under his lordly feet,
  All Flocks, and Herds, by thy commanding word,
    All beasts that in the field or forrest meet.

  Fowl of the Heavens, and Fish that through the wet
    Sea-paths in shoals do slide. And know no dearth.
  O Jehovah our Lord how wondrous great
    And glorious is thy name through all the earth.

              Psalm LXXX.

  1 Thou Shepherd that dost Israel [keep]
    Give ear [in time of need,]
  Who leadest like a flock of sheep
    [Thy loved] Josephs seed,
  That sitt'st between the Cherubs [bright]
    [Between their wings out-spread]
  Shine forth, [and from thy cloud give light,]
    [And on our foes thy dread.]
  2 In Ephraims view and Benjamins,
    And in Manasse's sight
  Awake thy strength, come, and [be seen]
    [To] save us [by thy might.]
  3 Turn us again, [thy grace divine]
    [To us] O God [vouchsafe;]
  Cause thou thy face on us to shine
    And then we shall be safe.
  4 Lord God of Hosts, how long wilt thou,
    How long wilt thou declare
  Thy smoaking wrath, [and angry brow]
    Against thy peoples praire.
  5 Thou feed'st them with the bread of tears,
    Their bread with tears they eat,
  And mak'st them largely drink the tears
   [Wherwith their cheeks are wet.]
  6 A strife thou mak'st us and a prey
    To every neighbour foe,
  Among themselves they laugh, they play,
    And flouts at us they throw.
  7 Return us, [and thy grace divine,]
    O God of Hosts [vouchsafe]
  Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
    And then we shall be safe.
  Vine from Aegypt thou hast brought,
    [Thy free love made it thine,]
  And drov'st out Nations proud and haut
    To plant this [lovely] Vine.
  9 Thou did'st prepare for it a place
    And root it deep and fast
  That it [began to grow apace,]
    [And] fill'd the land [at last.]
  10 With her [green] shade [that] cover'd [all,]
    The Hills were [over-spread]
  Her Bows as [high] as Cedars tall
    [Advanc'd their lofty head.]
  11 Her branches [on the western side]
    Down to the Sea she sent,
  And [upward] to that river [wide]
    Her other branches [went.]
  12 Why hast thou laid her Hedges low
    And brok'n down her Fence,
  That all may pluck her, as they go,
    [With rudest violence?]
  13 The [tusked] Boar out of the wood
    Up turns it by the roots,
  Wild Beasts there brouze, and make their food
    [Her Grapes and tender Shoots.]
  14 Return now, God of Hosts, look down
    From Heav'n, thy Seat divine,
  Behold [us, but without a frown,]
    And visit this [thy] Vine.
  15 Visit this Vine, which thy right hand
    Hath set, and planted [long,]
  And the young branch, that for thy self
    Thou hast made firm and strong.
  16 But now it is consum'd with fire,
    And cut [with Axes] down,
  They perish at thy dreadfull ire,
    At thy rebuke and frown.
  17 Upon the man of thy right hand
    Let thy [good] hand be [laid,]
  Upon the Son of Man, whom thou
    Strong for thyself hast made.
  18 So shall we not go back from thee
    [To wayes of sin and shame,]
  Quick'n us thou, then [gladly] wee
    Shall call upon thy Name.
  Return us, [and thy grace divine]
    Lord God of Hosts [voutsafe,]
  Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
    And then we shall be safe.

             Psalm LXXXI.

  1 To God our strength sing loud, [and clear,]
    Sing loud to God [our King,]
  To Jacobs God, [that all may bear]
    Loud acclamations ring.
  2 Prepare a Hymn, prepare a Song
    The Timbrel hither bring
  The [cheerfull] Psaltry bring along
    And Harp [with] pleasant [string.]
  3 Blow, as is wont, in the new Moon
    With Trumpets [lofty sound,]
  Th' appointed time, day wheron
    Our solemn Feast [comes round.]
  4 This was a Statute [giv'n of old]
    For Israel [to observe]
  A Law of Jacobs God, [to hold]
    [From whence they might not swerve.]
  5 This he a Testimony ordain'd
    In Joseph, [not to change,]
  When as he pass'd through Aegypt land;
    The Tongue I heard, was strange.
  6 From burden, [and from slavish toyle]
    I set his shoulder free;
  His hands from pots, [and mirie soyle]
    Deliver'd were [by me.]
  7 When trouble did thee sore assaile,
    [On me then] didst thou call,
  And I to free thee [did not faile,]
    [And led thee out of thrall.]
  I answer'd thee in thunder deep
    With clouds encompass'd round;
  I tri'd thee at the water [steep]
    Of Meriba [renown'd.]
  8 Hear O my people, [heark'n well,]
    I testifie to thee
  [Thou antient flock] of Israel,
    If thou wilt list to mee,
  9 Through out the land of thy abode
    No alien God shall be
  Nor shalt thou to a forein God
    In honour bend thy knee.
  10 I am the Lord thy God which brought
    Thee out of Aegypt land
  Ask large enough, and I, [besought,]
    Will grant thy full demand.
  11 And yet my people would not [hear,]
    [Nor] hearken to my voice;
  And Israel [whom I lov'd so dear]
    Mislik'd me for his choice.
  12 Then did I leave them to their will
    And to their wandring mind;
  Their own conceits they follow'd still
    Their own devises blind.
  13 O that my people would [be wise]
    [To] serve me [all their daies,]
  And O that Israel would [advise]
    [To] walk my [righteous] waies.
  14 Then would I soon bring down their foes
    [That now so proudly rise,]
  And turn my hand against [all those]
    [That are] their enemies.
  15 Who hate the Lord should [then be fain]
    [To] bow to him and bend,
  But [they, His people, should remain,]
    Their time should have no end.
  16 And he would feed them [from the shock]
    With flower of finest wheat,
  And satisfie them from the rock
    With Honey [for their Meat.]

            Psalm LXXXII.

  1 God in the great assembly stands
    [Of Kings and lordly States,]
  Among the gods on both his hands
    He judges and debates.
  2 How long will ye pervert the right
    With judgment false and wrong
  Favouring the wicked [by your might,]
    [Who thence grow bold and strong?]
  3 Regard the weak and fatherless
    Dispatch the poor mans cause,
  And raise the man in deep distress
    By just and equal Lawes.
  4 Defend the poor and desolate,
    And rescue from the hands
  Of wicked men the low estate
    Of him [that help demands.]
  5 They know not nor will understand,
    In darkness they walk on,
  The Earths foundations all are mov'd
    And out of order gon.
  6 I said that ye were Gods, yea all
    The Sons of God most high
  7 But ye shall die like men, and fall
    As other Princes [die.]
  8 Rise God, judge thou the earth [in might,]
    This [wicked] earth redress,
  For thou art he who shalt by right
    The Nations all possess.

           Psalm LXXXIII.

  1 Be not thou silent now at length
    O God hold not thy peace,
  Sit not thou still O God of [strength]
    [We cry and do not cease.]
  2 For lo thy [furious] foes [now] swell
    And storm outrageously,
  And they that hate thee [proud and fell]
    Exalt their heads full hie.
  3 Against thy people they contrive
    Their Plots and Counsels deep,
  Them to ensnare they chiefly strive
    Whom thou dost hide and keep.
  4 Come let us cut them off say they,
    Till they no Nation be
  That Israels name for ever may
    Be lost in memory.
  5 For they consult with all their might,
    And all as one in mind
  Themselves against thee they unite
    And in firm union bind.
  6 The tents of Edom, and the brood
    Of [scornful] Ishmael,
  Moab, with them of Hagars blood
    [That in the Desart dwell,]
  7 Gebal and Ammon [there conspire,]
    And [hateful] Amalec,
  The Philistims, and they of Tyre
    [Whose hounds the Sea doth check.]
  8 With them great Asshur also bands
    [And doth confirm the knot,]
  [All these have lent their armed hands]
    To aid the Sons of Lot.
  9 Do to them as to Midian [bold]
    [That wasted all Coast.]
  To Sisera, and as [is told]
    [Thou didst] to Jabins [hoast,]
  [When] at the brook of Kishon [old]
    [They were repulst and slain,]
  10 At Endor quite cut off, and rowl'd
    As dung upon the plain.
  11 As Zeb and Oreb evil sped
    So let their Princes speed
  As Zeba, and Zalmunna bled
    So let their Princes bleed.
  12 [For they amidst their pride] have said
    By right now shall we seize
  Gods houses, and [will now invade]
    Their stately Palaces.
  13 My God, oh make them as a wheel
    [No quiet let them find,]
  Giddy and restless let [them reel]
    Like stubble from the wind.
  14 As [when] an [aged] wood takes fire
    [Which on a sudden straies,]
  The [greedy] flame runs hier and hier
    Till all the mountains blaze,
  15 So with thy whirlwind them pursue,
    And with thy tempest chase;
  16 And till they yield thee honour due,
    Lord fill with shame their face.
  17 Asham'd and troubl'd let them be,
    Troubl'd and sham'd for ever,
  Ever confounded, and so die
    With shame, [and scape it never.]
  18 Then shall they know that thou whose name
    Jehova is alone,
  Art the most high, [and thou the same]
    O're all the earth [art one.]

           Psalm LXXXIV.

  1 How lovely are thy dwellings fair!
    O Lord of Hoasts, how dear
  The [pleasant] Tabernacles are!
    [Where thou do'st dwell so near.]
  2 My Soul doth long and almost die
    Thy Courts O Lord to see,
  My heart and flesh aloud do crie,
    O living God, for thee.
  3 There ev'n the Sparrow [freed from wrong]
    Hath found a house of [rest,]
  The Swallow there, to lay her young
    Hath built her [brooding] nest,
  Ev'n [by] thy Altars Lord of Hoasts
    [They find their safe abode,]
  [And home they fly from round the Coasts]
    [Toward thee,] My King, my God.
  4 Happy, who in thy house reside
    Where thee they ever praise,
  5 Happy, whose strength in thee doth bide,
    And in their hearts thy waies.
  6 They pass through Baca's [thirstie] Vale,
    [That dry and barren ground]
  As through a fruitfull watry Dale
    Where Springs and Showrs abound.
  7 They journey on from strength to strength
    [With joy and gladsom cheer]
  [Till] all before [our] God [at length]
    In Sion do appear.
  8 Lord God of Hoasts hear [now] my praier
    O Jacobs God give ear,
  9 Thou God our shield look on the face
    Of thy anointed [dear.]
  10 For one day in thy Courts [to be]
    Is better, [and more blest]
  Then [in the joyes of Vanity,]
    A thousand daies [at best.]
  I in the temple of my God
    Had rather keep a dore,
  Then dwell in Tents, [and rich abode]
    With Sin [for evermore.]
  11 For God the Lord both Sun and Shield
    Gives grace and glory [bright,]
  No good from them shall be with-held
    Whose waies are just and right.
  12 Lord [God] of Hoasts [that raign'st on high,]
    That man is [truly] blest
  Who [only] on thee doth relie.
    And in thee only rest.

          Psalm LXXXV.

  1 Thy Land to favour graciously
    Thou hast not Lord been slack,
  Thou hast from [hard] Captivity
    Returned Jacob back.
  2 Th' iniquity thou didst forgive
    [That wrought] thy people woe,
  And all their Sin, [that did thee grieve]
    Hast hid [where none shall know.]
  3 Thine anger all thou hadst remov'd,
    And [calmly] didst return
  From thy fierce wrath which we had prov'd
    Far worse then fire to burn.
  4 God of our saving health and peace,
    Turn us, and us restore,
  Thine indignation cause to cease
    Toward us, [and chide no more.]
  5 Wilt thou be angry without end,
    For ever angry thus
  Wilt thou thy frowning ire extend
    From age to age on us?
  6 Wilt thou not turn, and [hear our voice]
    And us again revive,
  That so thy people may rejoyce
    By thee preserv'd alive.
  7 Cause us to see thy goodness Lord,
    To us thy mercy shew
  Thy saving health to us afford
    [And life in us renew.]
  8 [And now] what God the Lord will speak
    I will go [strait and] hear,
  For to his people he speaks peace
    And to his Saints [full dear,]
  To his dear Saints he will speak peace,
    But let them never more
  Return to folly, [but surcease]
    [To trespass as before.]
  9 Surely to such as do him fear
    Salvation is at hand
  And glory shall [ere long appear]
    [To] dwell within our Land.
  10 Mercy and Truth [that long were miss'd]
    Now [joyfully] are met
  [Sweet] Peace and Righteousness have kiss'd
    [And hand in hand are set.]
  11 Truth from the earth [like to a flowr]
    Shall bud and blossom [then,]
  And Justice from her heavenly bowr
    Look down [on mortal men.]
  12 The Lord will also then bestow
    Whatever thing is good
  Our Land shall forth in plenty throw
    Her fruits [to be our food.]
  13 Before him Righteousness shall go
    [His Royal Harbinger,]
  Then will he come, and not be slow
    His footsteps cannot err.

           Psalm LXXXVI.

  1 Thy [Gracious] ear, O Lord, encline,
    O hear me [I thee pray,]
  For I am poor, and almost pine
    With need, [and sad decay.]
  2 Preserve my soul, for I have trod
    Thy waies, and love the just,
  Save thou thy servant O my God
    Who [still] in thee doth trust.
  3 Pitty me Lord for daily the
    I call; 4 O make rejoyce
  Thy Servants Soul; for Lord to the
    I lift my soul [and voice,]
  5 For thou art good, thou Lord art prone
    To pardon, thou to all
  Art full of mercy, thou [alone]
    To them that on thee call.
  6 Unto my supplication Lord
    Give ear, and to the crie
  Of my [incessant] praiers afford
    Thy hearing graciously.
  7 I in the day of my distres
    Will call on thee [for aid;]
  For thou wilt [grant] me [free access]
    [And] answer, [what I pray'd.]
  8 Like thee among the gods is none
    O Lord, nor any works
  [Of all that other Gods have done]
    Like to thy [glorious] works.
  9 The Nations all whom thou hast made
    Shall come, [and all shall frame]
  To bow them low before thee Lord,
    And glorifie thy name.
  10 For great thou art, and wonders great
    By thy strong hand are done,
  Thou [in thy everlasting Seat]
    Remainest God alone.
  11 Teach me O Lord thy way [most right,]
    I in thy truth will bide,
  To fear thy name my heart unite
    [So shall it never slide.]
  12 Thee will I praise O Lord my God
    [Thee honour, and adore]
  With my whole heart, and blaze abroad
    Thy name for ever more.
  13 For great thy mercy is toward me,
    And thou hast free'd my Soul
  Eev'n from the lowest Hell set free
    [From deepest darkness foul.]
  14 O God the proud against me rise
    And violent men are met
  To seek my life, and in their eyes
    No fear of thee have set.
  15 But thou Lord art the God most mild
    Readiest thy grace to shew,
  Slow to be angry, and [art stil'd]
    Most mercifull, most true.
  16 O turn to me [thy face at length,]
    And me have mercy on,
  Unto thy servant give thy strength,
    And save thy hand-maids Son.
  17 Some sign of good to me afford,
    And let my foes [then] see
  And be asham'd, because then Lord
    Do'st help and comfort me.

            Psalm LXXXVII

  1 Among the holy Mountains [high]
    Is his foundation fast,
  [There Seated in his Sanctuary,]
    [His Temple there is plac't.]
  2 Sions [fair] Gates the Lord loves more
    Then all the dwellings [faire]
  Of Jacobs [Land, though there be store,]
    [And all within his care.]
  3 City of God, most glorious things
    Of thee [abroad] are spoke;
  4 I mention Egypt, [where proud Kings]
    [Did our forefathers yoke,]
  I mention Babel to my friends,
    Philistia [full of scorn,]
  And Tyre with Ethiops [utmost ends,]
    Lo this man there was born:
  5 But [twise that praise shall in our ear]
    Be said of Sion [last]
  This and this man was born in her,
    High God shall fix her fast.
  6 The Lord shall write it in a Scrowle
    That ne're shall be out-worn
  When he the Nations doth enrowle
    That this man there was born.
  7 Both they who sing, and they who dance
    [With sacred Songs are there,]
  In thee [fresh brooks, and soft streams glance]
    [And] all my fountains [clear.]

            Psalm LXXXVIII.

  1 Lord God that dost me save and keep,
    All day to thee I cry;
  And all night long, before the [weep]
    Before thee [prostrate lie.]
  2 Into thy presence let my praier
    [With sighs devout ascend]
  And to my cries, that [ceaseless are,]
    Thine ear with favour bend.
  3 For cloy'd with woes and trouble store
    Surcharg'd my Soul doth lie,
  My life [at death' s uncherful dore]
    Unto the grave draws nigh.
  4 Reck'n'd I am with them that pass
    Down to the [dismal] pit
  I am a man, but weak alas
    And for that name unfit.
  5 From life discharg'd and parted quite
    Among the dead [to sleep,]
  And like the slain [in bloody fight]
    That in the grave lie [deep.]
  Whom thou rememberest no more,
    Dost never more regard,
  Them from thy hand deliver'd o're
    [Deaths hideous house hath barr'd.]
  6 Thou in the lowest pit [profound]
    Hast set me [all forlorn,]
  Where thickest darkness [hovers round,]
    In horrid deeps [to mourn.]
  7 Thy wrath [from which no shelter saves]
    Full sore doth press on me;
  Thou break'st upon me all thy waves,
    And all thy waves break me.
  8 Thou dost my friends from me estrange,
    And mak'st me odious,
  Me to them odious, [for they change,]
    And I here pent up thus.
  9 Through sorrow, and affliction great
    Mine eye grows dim and dead,
  Lord all the day I thee entreat,
    My hands to thee I spread.
  10 Wilt thou do wonders on the dead,
    Shall the deceas'd arise
  And praise thee [from their loathsom bed]
    [With pale and hollow eyes?]
  11 Shall they thy loving kindness tell
    On whom the grave [hath hold,]
  Or they [who] in perdition [dwell]
    Thy faithfulness [unfold?]
  12 In darkness can thy mighty [hand]
    [Or] wondrous acts be known,
  Thy justice in the [gloomy] land
    Of [dark] oblivion?
  13 But I to thee O Lord do cry
    [E're yet my life be spent,]
  And [up to thee] my praier [doth hie]
    Each morn, and thee prevent.
  14 Why wilt thou Lord my soul forsake,
    And hide thy face from me,
  15 That am already bruis'd, and shake
    With terror sent from thee;
  Bruz'd, and afflicted and [so low]
    As ready to expire,
  While I thy terrors undergo
    Astonish'd with thine ire.
  16 Thy fierce wrath over me doth flow
    Thy threatnings cut me through.
  17 All day they round about me go,
    Like waves they me persue.
  18 Lover and friend thou hast remov'd
    And sever'd from me far.
  They [fly me now] whom I have lov'd,
    And as in darkness are.
                                    THE END
.
