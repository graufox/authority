                   TO MR. CYRIACK SKINNER UPON HIS BLINDNESS
                                 by John Milton

  Cyriack, this three years day these eys, though clear
    To outward view, of blemish or of spot;
    Bereft of light thir seeing have forgot,
    Nor to thir idle orbs doth sight appear
  Of Sun or Moon or Starre throughout the year,
    Or man or woman. Yet I argue not
    Against heavns hand or will, nor bate a jot
    Of heart or hope; but still bear vp and steer
  Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
    The conscience, Friend, to have lost them overply'd
    In libertyes defence, my noble task,
  Of which all Europe talks from side to side.
    This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask
    Content though blind, had I no better guide.
                                    THE END
.
