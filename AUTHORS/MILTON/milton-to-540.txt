                          TO SR HENRY VANE THE YOUNGER
                                 by John Milton

  Vane, young in yeares, but in sage counsell old,
    Then whome a better Senatour nere held
    The helme of Rome, when gownes not armes repelld
    The feirce Epeirot & the African bold,
  Whether to settle peace, or to unfold
    The drift of hollow states, hard to be spelld,
    Then to advise how warr may best, upheld,
    Move by her two maine nerves, Iron & Gold
  In all her equipage; besides to know
    Both spirituall powre & civill, what each meanes
    What which each thou hast learnt, which few have don.
  The bounds of either sword to thee wee ow.
    Therfore on thy firme hand religion leanes
    In peace, & reck'ns thee her eldest son.
                                    THE END
.
