 Scene, - In the end of the Fourth Act, in ENGLAND; through the rest of the

                                    ACT I.


                                   SCENE i.

                    An open Place.  Thunder and Lightning.

                            Enter three Witches.


111     I Witch    When shall we three meet again,
                   In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
        2 Witch    When the hurlyburly's done,
                   When the battle's lost and won.
        3 Witch    That will be ere the set of sun.
        I Witch    Where the place?
        2 Witch                     Upon the heath.
        3 Witch    There to meet with Macbeth
        I Witch    I come, Graymalkin!
            All    Paddock calls: -Anon!-
1110               Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
                   Hover through the fog and filthy air.

                             Witches vanish.


                               Scene ii.

                          A Camp near Forres

          Alarum within.  Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain,
            Lenox, with Attendants, meeting a bloody Soldier.


121      Duncan    What bloody man is that?  He can report,
                   As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
                   The newest state.
        Malcolm                      This is the sergeant,
                   Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
                   'Gainst my captivity. - Hail, brave friend!
                   Say to the king the knowledge of the broil,
                   As thou didst leave it.
        Soldier                            Doubtfully it stood;
                   As two spent swimmers that do cling together
                   And choke their art.  The merciless Macdonwald,-
1210               Worthy to be a rebel - for to that
                   The multiplying villanies of nature
                   Do swarm upon him, - from the Western isles
                   Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
                   And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
                   Showed like a rebel's whore.  But all's too weak
                   For brave Macbeth, - well he deserves that name, -
                   Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel,
                   Which smoked with bloody execution,
                   Like valour's minion, Carved out his passage
1220               Till he faced the slave;
                   And ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
                   Till he unseamed him from the nave to the chaps,
                   And fixed his head upon our battlements.
        Duncan     O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
       Soldier     As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
                   Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break;
                   So from that spring, whence comfort seemed to come,
                   Discomfort swells.  Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
                   No sooner justice had, with valour armed,
1230               Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
                   But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
                   With furbished arms and new supplies of men,
                   Began a fresh assault.
        Duncan                            Dismayed not this
                   Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
       Soldier                                       Yes;
                   As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
                   If I say sooth, I must report they were
                   As cannons overcharged with double cracks;
                   So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
1240               Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
                   Or memorize another Golgotha,
                   I cannot tell:--
                   But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.
        Duncan     So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
                   They smack of honour both.--Go, get him surgeons.

                              Exit Soldier, attended.

                   Who comes here?
       Malcolm                     The worthy Thane of Ross.
         Lenox     What a haste looks through his eyes!
                   So should he look that seems to speak things strange.

                                  Enter Ross.

          Ross     God save the king!
        Duncan                        Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?
1250      Ross     From Fife, great king;
                   Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
                   And fan our people cold.
                   Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
                   Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
                   The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
                   Till that Belladona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,
                   Confronted him with self-comparisons,
                   Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,
                   Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,
                   The victory fell on us.
1260    Duncan                             Great happiness!
          Ross     That now Sweno, the Norway's king, craves composition;
                   Nor would we deign him burial of his men
                   Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes-inch,
                   Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
        Duncan     No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
                   Our bosom interest:--go pronounce his present death,
                   And with his former title greet Macbeth
          Ross     I'll see it done.
1270    Duncan     What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

                                  Exeunt.



                                 Scene iii.

                                  A Heath.

                      Thunder.  Enter the three Witches.


131    I Witch     Where hath thou been, sister?
       2 Witch     Killing swine.
       3 Witch     Sister, where thou?
       1 Witch     A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
                   And munched, and munched, and munched:
                   --Give me, quoth I:
                   Aroint thee, witch! the rump-fed ronyon cries.
                   Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
                   But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
                   And, like a rat without a tail,
1310               I'll do, I'll do, I'll do.
       2 Witch     I'll give thee a wind.
       I Witch     Thou art kind.
       3 Witch     And I another.
       I Witch     I myself have all the other;
                   And the very ports they blow,
                   All the quarters that they know
                   I' the shipman's card.
                   I will drain him dry as hay:
                   Sleep shall neither night nor day
1320               Hang upon his pent-house lid;
                   He shall live a man forbid:
                   Weary seven-nights nine times nine
                   Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine:
                   Though his bark cannot be lost,
                   Yet it shall be tempest-tost.--
                   Look what I have.
       2 Witch     Show me, show me.
       I Witch     Here I have a pilot's thumb,
                   Wrecked as homeword he did come.

                            Drum within.

1330   3 Witch     A drum, A drum!
                   Macbeth doth come.
           All     The weird sisters, hand in hand,
                   Posters of sea and land,
                   Thus do go about, about:
                   Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
                   Peace!--the charm's wound up.

                         Enter Macbeth and Banquo

       Macbeth     So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
        Banquo     How far is't call's Forres?--What are these,
1340               So withered, and so wild in their attire,
                   That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
                   And yet are on't?--Live you? or are you aught
                   That man may question?  You seem to understand me,
                   By each at once her chappy finger laying
                   Upon her skinny lips:--you should be women,
                   And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
                   That you are so.
       Macbeth                      Speak if you can;--what are you?
       1 Witch     All hail, Macbeth!  hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
       2 Witch     All hail, Macbeth!  hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
1350   3 Witch     All hail, Macbeth!  that thou shalt be king hereafter!
        Banquo     Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
                   Things that do sound so fair?--I' the name of truth,
                   Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
                   Which outwardly ye show?  My noble partner
                   You greet with present grace and great prediction
                   Of noble having and of royal hope.
                   That he seems rapt withal:--to me you speak not:
                   If you can look into the seeds of time,
                   And say which grain will grow, and which will not,
1360               Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
                   Your favours nor your hate.
       I Witch     Hail!
       2 Witch     Hail!
       3 Witch     Hail!
       I Witch     Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
       2 Witch     Not so happy, yet much happier.
       3 Witch     Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none;
                   So, all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
       I Witch     Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
1370   Macbeth     Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
                   By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Clamis;
                   But how of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor lives,
                   A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
                   Stands not within the prospect of belief,
                   No more than to be Cawdor.  Say from whence
                   You owe this strange intelligence? or why
                   Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
                   With such prophetic greeting?--Speak, I charge you!

                              Witches vanish.

        Banquo     The earth hath bubbles, as the waters has,
1380               And these are of them:--wither are they vanished?
       Macbeth     Into the air; and what seemed corporeal melted
                   As breath into the wind.--Would they had stayed
        Banquo     Where such things here as we do speak about?
                   Or have we eaten on the insane root
                   That takes the reason prisoner?
       Macbeth     Your children shall be kings.
        Banquo                                   You shall be king.
       Macbeth     And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?
        Banquo     To the self-same tune and words.  Who's here?

                         Enter Ross and Angus

          Ross     The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
1390               The news of thy success: and, when he reads
                   Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
                   His wonders and his praises do contend
                   Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
                   In viewing o'er the rest o' the self-same day,
                   He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
                   Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
                   Strange images of death.  As thick as hail
                   Came post with post; and every one did bear
                   Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
                   And pored them down before him.
13100    Angus                                      We are sent
                   To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;
                   Only to herald thee into his sight,
                   Not pay thee.
          Ross     And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
                   He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
                   In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
                   For it is thine.
        Banquo                       What, can the devil speak true?
       Macbeth     The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
                   In borrowed robes?
         Angus                         Who was the thane lives yet;
13110              But under heavy judgment bears that life
                   Which he deserves to lose.  Whether he was combined
                   With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
                   With hidden help and vantage, or with both
                   He laboured in his country's wreck, I know not;
                   But treasons capital, confessed, and proved,
                   Have overthrown him.
       Macbeth                          Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor;
                   The greatest is behind [aside]. -Thanks for your pains.-
                   Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
                   When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
                   Promised no less to them?
13120   Banquo                               That, trusted home,
                   Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
                   Besides the Thane of Cawdor.  But 'tis strange:
                   And oftentimes to win us to our harm,
                   The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
                   Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
                   In deepest consequence.--
                   Cousins, a word I pray you.
       Macbeth                                  Two truths are told,
                   As happy prologues to the swelling act
                   Of the imerial theme [aside].--I thank you, gentlemen.-
13130              [aside] This supernatural soliciting
                   Cannot be ill; cannot be good:--if ill,
                   Why hath it given me earnest of suggest,
                   Commencing in a truth?  I am Thane of Cawdor:
                   If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
                   whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,
                   And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
                   Against the use of nature?  Present fears
                   Are less than horrible imaginings:
                   My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
13140              Shakes so my single state of man, that function
                   Is smothered in surmise; and nothing is
                   But what is not.
        Banquo                      Look, how our partner's rapt.
       Macbeth     [Aside.]
                   If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
                   Without my stir.
        Banquo                       New honours come upon him,
                   Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
                   But with the aid of use.
       Macbeth     [Aside.]                  Come what come may,
                   Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
        Banquo     Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
       Macbeth     Give me your favour:--my dull brain was wrought
13150              With things forgotten.  Kind gentlemen, your pains
                   are registered where everyday I turn
                   The leaf to read them.--Let us toward the king.--
                   Think upon what hath chanced; and, at more time,
                   The interim having weighed it, let us speak
                   Our free hearts to each other.
        Banquo                                     Very gladly.
       Macbeth     Till then, enough.--Come, friends.

                                  Exeunt.

                            A room in the Palace.

                  Flourish.  Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain,
                            Lenox and Attendants.


141     Duncan     Is execution done on Cawdor?  Are not
                   Those in commission yet returned?
       Malcolm                                       My liege,
                   They are not yet come back.  But I have spoke
                   With one that saw him die: who did report,
                   That very frankly he confessed his treasons;
                   Implored your highness' pardon; and set forth
                   A deep repentance: nothing in his life
                   Became him like the leaving it; he died
                   As one that had been studied in his death,
1410               To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
                   As 'twere a careless trifle.
        Duncan                                   There's no art
                   To find the mind's construction in the face:
                   He was a gentleman on whom I built
                   An absolute trust.-

                 Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.

                                        O worthiest cousin!
                   The sin of my ingratitude even now
                   Was heavy on me: thou art so far before,
                   That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
                   To overtake thee.  Would thou hadst less deserved;
                   That the proportion both of thanks and payment
1420               Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
                   More is thy due than more than all can pay.
       Macbeth     The service and the royalty I owe,
                   In doing it, pays itself.   Your Highness?  part
                   Is to receive our duties: and our duties
                   Are to your throne and state children and servants;
                   Which do but what they should, by doing everything
                   Safe toward your love and honour.
        Duncan                                        Welcome hither:
                   I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
                   To make thee full of growing.--Noble Banquo,
1430               That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
                   No less to have done so, let me infold thee,
                   And hold thee to my heart.
        Banquo                                There if I grow,
                   The harvest is your own.
        Duncan                              My plenteous joys,
                   Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
                   In drops of sorow.--Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
                   And you whose places are the nearest, know,
                   We will establish our estate upon
                   Our dearest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter
                   The Prince of Cumberland: which honour must
1440               Not unaccompanied invest him only,
                   But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
                   On all deservers.--From hence to Inverness,
                   And bind us further to you.
       Macbeth     The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
                   I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
                   The hearing of my wife with your approach;
                   So, humbly take my leave.
        Duncan                               My worthy Cawdor!
       Macbeth     [Aside] The Prince of Cumberland!--That is a step,
                   In which I must fall down, or else o'er leap
1450               For in my way it lies.  Stars, hide your fires!
                   Let not light see my black and deep desires:
                   The wink at the hand! yet let that be,
                   Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

                                    Exit.

        Duncan     True. worthy Banquo,--he is full so valiant;
                   And in his commendations I am fed,--
                   It is a banquet to me.  Let us after him,
                   Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
                   It is a peerless kinsman.

                                 Flourish.  Exeunt.

                          A room in Macbeth's Castle.

                     Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.


151  L. Macbeth    "They met me in the day of success; and I have learned
                   by the perfectest report, they have more in them than
                   mortal knowledge.  When I burned in desire to question
                   them further, they made themselves air, into which they
                   vanished.  While I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came
                   missives from the king, who all-hailed me 'Thane of
                   Cawdor'; by which title, before, these weird sisters
                   saluted me, and referred me to the coming-on of time,
                   with 'Hail, king that shalt be!'  This have I thought
                   good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
                   that thou might'st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by
1510               being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.  Lay
                   it to thy heart, and farewell."

                   Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
                   What thou art promised.--Yet do I fear thy nature:
                   It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
                   To catch the nearest way.  Thou wouldst be great;
                   Art not without ambition, but without
                   The illness that should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
                   That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
1520               And yet wouldst wrongly win; thou'dst have, great Glamis,
                   That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it";
                   And that which rather thou dost fear to do,
                   Than wishest should be undone.  Hie thee hither,
                   That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
                   And chatise with the valour of my tongue
                   All that impedes thee from the golden round,
                   Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
                   To have thee crowned withal.--

                               Enter a Messenger

                                                    What is your tidings?
      Messenger    The king comes here tonight.
   Lady Macbeth                                 Thou'rt mad to say it.
1530               Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
                   Would have informed for preparation.
      Messenger    So please you, it is true; our thane is coming;
                   One of the fellows had the speed of him,
                   Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
                   Than would make up his message.
   Lady Macbeth                                    Give him tending:

                                Exit Messenger

                   He brings great news.  The raven himself is hoarse
                   That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
                   Under my battlements.  Come you spirits
                   That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
1540               And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full
                   Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood,
                   Stop up th' access and passage of remorse;
                   That no compunctious visitings of nature
                   Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
                   Th' effect and it!  Come to my woman's breasts,
                   And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
                   Wherever in your sightless substances
                   You wait on nature's mischief!  Come, thick night,
                   And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
1550               That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
                   Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
                   To cry, "Hold, hold!"

                                 Enter Macbeth

                                            Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
                   Greater than both, by the all-hail, hereafter!
                   Thy letters have transported me beyond
                   This ignorant present, and I feel now
                   The future in an instant.
        Macbeth                               My dearest love,
                   Duncan comes here tonight.
   Lady Macbeth                                And when goes hence?
        Macbeth    Tomorrow, as he purposes.
   Lady Macbeth                               O! never
                   Shall sun that morrow see!
1560               Your face, my thane, is as a book, where men
                   May read strange matters.  To beguile the time,
                   Look like the time, bear welcome in your eye
                   Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower
                   But be the serpent under 't.  He that's coming
                   Must be provided for;  and you shall put
                   This night's great business into my despatch;
                   Which shall to all our nights and days to come
                   Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
        Macbeth    We will speak further.
   Lady Macbeth                           Only look up clear;
1570               To alter favour ever is to  fear.
                   Leave all the rest to me.

                             Hautboys and torches.

               Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lenox,
                     Macduff, Ross, Angus, and Attendants.


161      Duncan    This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
                   Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
                   Unto our gentle senses.
         Banquo                            This guest of summer,
                   The temple-haunting martlet, doth approve,
                   By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
                   Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
                   Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
                   Hath made his pendent bed, and procreat cradle:
                   Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
                   The air is delicate.

                              Enter Lady Macbeth

1610                                      See, see! our honoured hostess.--
                   The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
                   Which still we thank as love.  Herein I teach you,
                   How you shall bid God yield us for your pains,
                   And thank us for your trouble.
   Lady Macbeth                                    All our service,
                   In every point twice done, and done double,
                   Were poor and single business to contend
                   Against those honours deep and broad, wherewith
                   Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
                   And the late dignities heaped up to them,
                   We rest your hermits.
1620     Duncan                           Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
                   We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
                   To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
                   And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
                   To his home before us.  Fair and noble hostess,
                   We are your guest tonight.
   Lady Macbeth                                Your servants ever
                   Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
                   To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
                   Shall to return your own.
         Duncan                               Give me your hand;
                   Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
1630               And shall continue our graces towards him.
                   By your leave, hostess.

                             Hautboys and torches
                   Enter, and pass over the stage, a Sewer,
                 and divers Servants with dishes and service.

                              Then enter Macbeth.

                   [Aside]
171     Macbeth    If it were done when 't is done, then 't were well
                   It were done quickly: if the assassination
                   Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
                   With his surcease success; that but this blow
                   Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
                   But here upon this bank and shoal of time,
                   We 'd jump the life to come. --But in these cases,
                   We still have judgement here, that we but teach
                   Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
1710               To plague th' inventor: this even-handed justice
                   Commends th' ingredients of our poisoned chalice
                   To our own lips.  He 's here in double trust:
                   First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
                   Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
                   Who should against his murderer shut the door,
                   Not bear the knife myself.  Besides, this Duncan
                   Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
                   So clear in his great office, that his virtues
                   Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
1720               The deep damnation of his taking-off;
                   And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
                   Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, horsed
                   Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
                   Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
                   That tears shall drown the wind. --I have no spur
                   To prick the sides of my intent, but only
                   Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
                   And falls on the other --

                              Enter Lady Macbeth

                                              How now! what news?
   Lady Macbeth    He has almost supped.  Why have you left the chamber?
        Macbeth    Hath he asked for me?
   Lady Macbeth                           Know you not he has?             1730
        Macbeth    We will proceed no further in this business:
                   He hath honoured me of late; and I have bought
                   Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
                   Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
                   Not cast aside so soon.
   Lady Macbeth                             Was the hope drunk,
                   Wherein you dressed yourself? hath it slept since,
                   And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
                   At what it did so freely?  From this time
                   Such I account thy love.  Art thou afeard
1740               To be the same in thine own act and valour,
                   As thou art in desire?  Wouldst thou have that
                   Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
                   And live a coward in thine own esteem,
                   Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"
                   Like the poor cat i' the adage?
        Macbeth                                     Pr'ythee, peace.
                   I dare do all that may become a man;
                   Who dares do more is none.
   Lady Macbeth                                What beast was 't then
                   That made you break this enterprise to me?
                   When you durst do it, then you were a man;
1750               And, to be more that what you were, you would
                   Be so much more the man.  Nor time nor place
                   Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
                   They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
                   Does unmake you.  I have given suck, and know
                   How tender  't is to love the babe that milks me:
                   I would, while it was smiling in my face,
                   Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums,
                   And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you
                   Have done to this.
        Macbeth                        If we should fail, --
   Lady Macbeth                                               We fail!
1760               But screw your courage to the sticking-place
                   And we 'll not fail.  When Duncan is asleep
                   (Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
                   Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains
                   Will I with wine and wassail so convince,
                   That memory, the warder of the brain,
                   Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason,
                   A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
                   Their drenched natures lie, as in death,
                   What cannot you and I perform upon
1770               Th' unguarded Duncan?  What not put upon
                   His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
                   Of our great quell?
        Macbeth                        Bring forth men-children only!
                   For thy undaunted mettle should compose
                   Nothing but males.  Will it not be received,
                   When we have marked with blood those sleepy two
                   Of his own chamber, and used their very daggers,
                   That they have done 't?
   Lady Macbeth                             Who dares receive it other,
                   As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
                   Upon his death?
1780    Macbeth                     I am settled, and bend up
                   Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
                   Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
                   False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

                                    Exeunt.





                                    ACT II

                                    Scene I

                     The same.  A court within the castle

              Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before him.



211      Banquo     How goes the night, boy?
        Fleance     The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
         Banquo     And she goes down at twelve.
        Fleance                                   I take 't, 't is later, Sir.
         Banquo     Hold, take my sword.--There 's husbandry in heaven;
                    Their candles are all out.--Take thee that, too.
                    A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
                    And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers!
                    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
                    Gives way to in repose!--Give me my sword.

                  Enter Macbeth, and a Servant with a torch.

2110                Who 's there?
        Macbeth                    A friend.
         Banquo     What, Sir! not yet at rest?  The king 's a-bed:
                    He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
                    Sent forth great largess to your offices.
                    This diamond he greets your wife withal,
                    By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
                    In measureless content.
        Macbeth                              Being unprepared,
                   Our will became the servant to defect,
                   Which else should free have wrought.
         Banquo                                           All 's well.
2120               I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
                   To you they have showed some truth.
        Macbeth                                         I think not of them:
                   Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
                   We would spend it in some words upon that business,
                   If you would grant the time.
         Banquo                                  At your kind'st leisure.
        Macbeth    If you shall cleave to my consent, when 't is,
                   It shall make honour for you.
         Banquo                                   So I lose none
                   In seeking to augment it, but still keep
                   My bosom franchised, and allegiance clear,
                   I shall be counselled.
        Macbeth                           Good repose the while!
2130     Banquo    Thanks, Sir: the like to you.

                           Exeunt Banquo and Fleance

                               [To the servant]

        Macbeth    Go, bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
                   She strike upon the bell.  Get thee to bed.--

                                 Exit Servant

                   Is this a dagger which I see before me,
                   The handle toward my hand?  Come let me clutch thee:--
                   I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
                   Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
                   To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
                   A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
                   Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
2140               I see thee yet, in form as palpable
                   As this which now I draw.
                   Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
                   And such an instrument I was to use.--
                   Mine eyes are made the fools o' the senses,
                   Or else worth all the rest;  I see thee still;
                   And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
                   Which was not so before.--There 's no such thing.
                   It is the bloody business which informs
                   Thus to mine eyes.--Now o'er the half world
2150               Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
                   The curtained sleep: witchcraft celebrates
                   Pale Hecate's offerings; and withered Murder,
                   Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,
                   Whose howl 's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
                   With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
                   Moves like a ghost.--Thou sure and firm-set earth,
                   Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
                   Thy very stones prate of my where-about,
                   And take the present horror from the time,
2160               Which now suits with it.  Whiles I threat, he lives:
                   Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

                                 A bell rings

                   I go, and it is done: the bell invites me.
                   Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
                   That summons thee to heaven to to hell.

                                                                                Exit




                                    Scene ii

                                    The same.

                               Enter Lady Macbeth.

221Lady Macbeth    That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.
                   What hath quenched them hath given me fire.--Hark!--Peace!
                   It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,
                   Which gives the stern'st good-night.  He is about it.
                   The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
                   Do mock their charge with snores.  I have drugged their
                   That death and nature do contend about them,       [possets,
                   Whether they live or die.

                   [Within]
        Macbeth                                Who's there?--what, ho!
   Lady Macbeth    Alack!  I am afraid they have awaked,
2210               And 't is not done:--th' attempt, and not the deed,
                   Confounds us.--Hark!--I laid their daggers ready;
                   He could not miss them.--Had he not resembled
                   My father as he slept, I had done 't.--My husband!

                                 Enter Macbeth

        Macbeth    I have done the deed.--Didst thou not hear a noise?
   Lady Macbeth    I heard the owl scream, and the crickets cry.
                   Did you not speak?
        Macbeth                        When?
   Lady Macbeth                               Now.
        Macbeth                                      As I descended?
   Lady Macbeth    Ay.
        Macbeth    Hark!--
                            Who lies i' the second chamber?
   Lady Macbeth                                              Donalbain.
2220    Macbeth    This is a sorry sight.  [Looking at his hands]
   Lady Macbeth    A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
        Macbeth    There 's one did laugh in  's sleep, and one cried, "Murder!"
                   That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them;
                   But they did say their prayers, and addressed them
                   Again to sleep.
   Lady Macbeth                     There are two lodged together.
        Macbeth    One cried, "God bless us!" and, "Amen," the other,
                   As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
                   Listening their fear, I could not say, "Amen,"
                   When they did say, "God bless us!"
   Lady Macbeth                                       Consider it not so deeply.
2230    Macbeth    But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
                   I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
                   Stuck in my throat.
   Lady Macbeth                         These deeds must not be thought
                   After these ways: so, it will make us mad.
        Macbeth    Methought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
                   Macbeth does murder sleep,"--the innocent sleep;
                   Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleave of care,
                   The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
                   Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
                   Chief nourisher in life's feast;--
   Lady Macbeth                                        What do you mean?
2240    Macbeth    Still it cried, "Sleep not more!" to all the house:
                   "Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor
                   Shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more!"
   Lady Macbeth    Who was it that thus cried?  Why, worthy thane,
                   You do unbend your nobel strength, to think
                   So brainsickly of things.  Go, get some water,
                   And wash this filthy witness from your hand.--
                   Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
                   They must lie there; go, carry them, and smear
                   The sleepy grooms with blood.
        Macbeth                                   I'll go no more:
2250               I am afraid to think what I have done;
                   Look on 't again I dare not.
   Lady Macbeth                                  Infirm of purpose!
                   Give me the daggers.  The sleeping and the dead
                   Are but as pictures; 't is the eye of childhood
                   That fears a painted devil.  If he do bleed,
                   I 'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
                   For it must seem their guilt.

                            Exit.  Knocking within.

        Macbeth    Whence is that knocking?--
                   How is 't with me, when every noise appals me?
                   What hands are here? Ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
                   Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
2260               Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
                   The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
                   Making the green one red.

                             Re-enter Lady Macbeth

   Lady Macbeth    My hands are of your colour; But I shame
                   To wear a heart so white. [Knock] I hear a knocking
                   At the south entry: retire we to our chamber.
                   A little water clears us of this deed:
                   How easy is it then!  Your constancy
                   Hath left you unattended.--[Knock] Hark! more knocking.
                   Get on your night-gown, lest occasion call us,
2270               And show us to be watchers.--Be not lost
                   So poorly in your thoughts.
        Macbeth    To know my deed, 't were best not know myself.  [Knock]
                   Wake Duncan with thy knocking: I would thou couldst!

                                    Exeunt



                                   Scene iii

                                   The same.

                                Enter a Porter.


231      Porter    Here 's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of
                   hell-gate, he should have old turning the key.
                   [Knocking]  Knock, knock, knock.  Who 's there,
                   i' the name of Belzebub?--Here 's a farmer that
                   hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come
                   in time; have napkins enough about you; here you 'll
                   sweat for 't. [Knocking] Knock, knock.  Who 's there,
                   i' the other devil's name?--'Faith, here's an
                   equivocator that could swear in both the scales
                   against either scale; who committed treason enough
                   for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven:
2310               O! come in, equivocator. [Knocking] Knock, knock,
                   knock. Who 's there?--'Faith, here 's an English tailor
                   come hither for stealing out of a French hose: come in,
                   tailor; here you may rest your goose. [Knocking] Knock,
                   knock.  Never at quiet? What are you?--But this place is
                   too cold for hell. I 'll devil-porter it no further:
                   I had thought to have let in some of all professions
                   that go the primrose way to the ever-lasting bonfire.
                   [Knocking] Anon, anon: I pray you, remember the porter.

                                Opens the gate.

        Macduff    Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
2320               That you do lie so late?
         Porter    'Faith, Sir, we were carousing till the second cock;
                   And drink, Sir, is a geat provoker of three things.
        Macduff    What three things does drink especially provoke?
         Porter    Marry, Sir, nose-painting, sleep and urine.  Lechery,
                   Sir, it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire,
                   but it takes away the performance.  Therefore, much drink
                   may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes
                   him and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off;
                   it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to,
                   and not stand to: in conclusion, equivocates him in a
2330               sleep, and, giving him the lie leaves him.
        Macduff    I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
         Porter    That it did, Sir, i' the very throat o' me: but I requited
                   him for his lie; and, I think, being too strong for him,
                   though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to
                   cast him.
        Macduff    Is thy master stirring?
         Porter    Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

                                 Enter Macbeth

          Lenox    Good morrow, noble Sir!
        Macbeth                             Good morrow, both!
        Macduff    Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
2340    Macbeth                                          Not yet.
        Macduff    He did command me to call timely on him:
                   I have almost slipped the hour.
        Macbeth                                     I 'll bring you to him.
        Macduff    I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
                   But yet  't is one.
        Macbeth                        The labour we delight in physics pain.
                   This is the door.
        Macduff                       I 'll make so bold to call.
                   For 't is my limited service.

                                 Exit Macduff

          Lenox    Goes the king hence today?
        Macduff                                 He does:--he did appoint so.
          Lenox    The night has been unruly: where we lay,
2350               Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
                   Lamentings heard i' the air; strange creams of death,
                   And prophesying with accents terrible
                   Of dire combustion, and confused events,
                   New hatched to the woeful time.
                   The obscure bird clamoured the livelong night:
                   Some say the earth was feverous, and did shake.
        Macbeth    'T was a rough night.
          Lenox    My young remembrance cannot parallel
                   A fellow to it.

                               Re-enter Macduff

2360    Macduff    O horror! horror! horror!  Tongue, nor heart,
                   Cannot conceive, nor name thee!
Macbeth and Lenox                                   What's the matter?
        Macduff    Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
                   Most sacrilegious murder hath broke open
                   The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
                   The life o' the building!
        Macbeth                               What is 't you say? the life?
          Lenox    Mean you his majesty?
        Macduff    Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
                   With a new Gorgon.--Do not bed me speak:
                   See, and then speak yourselves.--

                           Exeunt Macbeth and Lenox

                                                        Awake! Awake!--
2370               Ring the alarum-bell.--Murder and treason!
                   Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
                   Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
                   And look on death itself!--up, up, and see
                   The great doom's image!--Malcolm! Banquo!
                   As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites
                   To countenance this horror!  Ring the bell.

                                  Bell rings

                              Enter Lady Macbeth

   Lady Macbeth    What's the business,
                   That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
2380               The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
        Macduff                                              O gentle lady,
                   'T is not for you to hear what I can speak:
                   The repetition, in a woman's ear,
                   Would murder as it fell.

                                 Enter Banquo

                                              O Banquo! Banquo!
                   Our royal master 's murdered!
   Lady Macbeth                                    Woe, alas!
                   What! in our house?
         Banquo                         Too cruel anywhere.
                   Dear Duff, I pr'ythee, contradict thyself,
                   And say it is not so.

                         Re-enter Macbeth and Lenox

        Macbeth    Had I but died an hour before this chance,
                   I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
                   There 's nothing serious inmortality;
2390               All is but toys: renown, and grace, is dead;
                   The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
                   Is left this vault to brag of.

                          Enter Malcolm and Donalbain

      Donalbain    What is amiss?
        Macbeth                     You are, and do not know 't:
                   The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
                   Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.
        Macduff    Your royal father 's murdered.
        Malcolm                                     O! by whom?
          Lenox    Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done 't:
                   Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;
                   So were their daggers, which, unwiped, we found
23100              Upon their pillows:
                   They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
                   Was to be trusted with them.
        Macbeth    O! yet I do repent me of my fury
                   That I did kill them.
        Macduff                            Wherefore did you so?
        Macbeth    Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
                   Loyal and neutral, in a moment?  No man:
                   The expedition of my violent love
                   Outran the pauser reason.--Here lay Duncan,
                   His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
23110              And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature
                   For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
                   Steeped in the colours of their trade, their daggers
                   Unmannerly breached with gore.  Who could refrain,
                   That had a heart to love, and in that heart
                   Courage, to make 's love known?
   Lady Macbeth    [Fainting]                         Help me hence, ho!
        Macduff    Look to the lady.

        Malcolm    [aside to Donalbain]     Why do we hold our tongues,
                   That most may claim this argument for ours?
      Donalbain    What should be spoken here, where our fate,
23120              Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
                   Let's away;
                   Our tears are not yet brewed.
        Malcolm                                   Nor our strong sorrow
                   Upon the foot of motions.
         Banquo                               Look to the lady:--

                          Lady Macbeth is carried out.

                   And when we have our naked frailties hid,
                   That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
                   And question this most bloody piece of work,
                   To know it further.  Fears and scruples shake us:
                   In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
                   Against the undivulged pretence I fight
                   Of treasonous malice.
        Macduff                           And so do I.
23130       All                                         So all.
        Macbeth    Let 's briefly put on manly readiness,
                   And meet i' the hall together.
            All                                    Well contented.

                     Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain

        Malcolm    What will you do?  Let 's not consort with them:
                   To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
                   Which the false man does easy.  I 'll to England.
      Donalbain    To Ireland, I: our separated fortune
                   Shall keep us both the safer; where we are
                   There 's daggers in men's smiles the near in blood,
                   The nearer bloody.
       Malcolm                        This murderous shaft that 's shot
23140              Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
                   Is to avoid the aim: therfore, to horse,
                   And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
                   But shift away.  There 's warrant in that theft
                   Which steals itself, when there 's no mercy left.

                                    Exeunt.



                                   Scene iv

                              Outside the Castle.

                           Enter Ross and an Old Man.


241     Old Man    Threescore and ten I can remember well;
                   Within the volume of which time I have seen
                   Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night
                   Hath trifled former knowings.
           Ross                                   Ha, good father,
                   Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
                   Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock 't is day,
                   And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
                   Is 't night's predominance, not the day's shame,
                   That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
                   When living light should kiss it?
2410    Old Man                                      'T is unnatural,
                   Even like the deed that 's done.  On Tuesday last,
                   A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
                   Was by a mousing owl hawked at, and killed.
           Ross    And Duncan's horses (a thing most strange and certain)
                   Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
                   Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
                   Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
                   War with mankind.
        Old Man                      'T is said, they ate each other.
           Ross    They did so, to th' amazement of mine eyes,
                   That looked upon 't--

                                   Enter Macduff

2420                                       Here comes the good Macduff.--
                   How goes the world, Sir, now?
        Macduff                                   Why, see you not?
           Ross    Is 't known, who did this more than bloody deed?
        Macduff    Those that Macbeth hath slain.
           Ross                                    Alas, the day!
                   What good could they pretend?
        Macduff                                    They were suborned.
                   Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
                   Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
                   Suspicion of the deed.
           Ross                           'Gainst nature still:
                   Thriftless Ambition, that wilt ravin up
                   Thine own life's means!--Then 't is most like
2430               The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
        Macduff    He is already named, and gone to Scone
                   To be invested.
           Ross                     Where is Duncan's body?
        Macduff    Carried to Colme-kill,
                   The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
                   And guardian of their bones.
          Ross                                   Will you to Scone?
        Macduff    No, cousin; I 'll to Fife.
           Ross                                Well, I will thither.
        Macduff    Well, may you see things well done there:--adieu!--
                   Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
           Ross    Farewell, father.
        Old Man    God's benison go with you; and with those
2440               That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

                                                                                Exeunt






                                   ACT THREE

                                    Scene i

                         Forres. A room in the palace.

                                 Enter Banquo.


311      Banquo    Thou hast it now, King Cawdor, Glamis, all,
                   As the weird women promised; and, I fear,
                   Thou playst most foully for 't; yet it was said,
                   It should not stand in thy posterity;
                   But that myself should be the root and father
                   Of many kings.  If there come truth from them
                   (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine),
                   Why, by the verities on thee made good,
                   May they not be my oracles as well,
3110               And set me up in hope?  But, hush; no more.


                                Sennet sounded.

                 Enter Macbeth as King; Lady Macbeth as Queen;
                      Lenox, Ross, Lords, and Attendants.


        Macbeth    Here 's our chief guest.
   Lady Macbeth                             If he had been forgotten,
                   It had been as a gap in our great feast,
                   And all-thing unbecoming.
        Macbeth    Tonight we hold a solemn supper, Sir,
                   And I 'll request your presence.
         Banquo                                      Let your highness
                   Command upon me, to the which my duties
                   Are with a most indissoluble tie
                   For ever knit.
        Macbeth    Ride you this afternoon?
         Banquo                              Ay, my good lord.
3120    Macbeth    We should have else desired your good advice
                   (Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)
                   In this day's council; but we 'll take tomorrow.
                   Is 't far you ride?
         Banquo    As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
                   'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
                   I must become a borrower of the night
                   For a dark hour or twain.
        Macbeth                               Fail not our feast.
         Banquo    My lord, I will not.
        Macbeth    We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed
3130               In England and in Ireland; not confessing
                   Their cruel patricide, filling their hearers
                   With strange invention.  But of that tomorrow,
                   When, therewithal, we shall have cause of state
                   Craving us jointly.  Hie you to horse; adieu,
                   Till you return at night.  Goes Fleance with you?
         Banquo    Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
        Macbeth    I wish your horse swift, and sure of foot;
                   And so I do commend you to their backs.
                   Farewell--

                                 Exit Banquo.

3140               Let every man be master of his time
                   Till seven at night; to make society
                   The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
                   Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you.

                       Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, etc.

                   [To an Attendant]
                   Sirrah, a word with you.  Attend those men
                   Our pleasure?
      Attendant                   They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
        Macbeth    Bring them before us.

                                Exit Attendant.

                                          --To be thus is nothing,
                   But to be safely thus.--Our fears in banquo
                   Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
3150               Reigns that which would be feared; 't is much he dares;
                   And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
                   He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
                   To act in safety.  There is none but he
                   Whose being I do fear: and under him
                   My genius is rebuked, as, it is said,
                   Mark Antony's was by Caesar.  He chid the sisters
                   When first they put the name of king upon me,
                   And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,
                   They hailed him father to a line of kings.
3160               Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
                   And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
                   Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,
                   No son of mine succeeding.  If 't be so,
                   For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
                   For them the gracious Duncan have i murdered;
                   Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
                   Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
                   Given to the common enemy of man,
                   To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
3170               Rather than so, come, fate, into the list,
                   And champion me to the utterance!--Who 's there?--

                    Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers.

                   [To the Attendant]
                   Now, go to the door, and stay there till we call.

                                Exit Attendant.

                   [To the Murderers]
                   Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
     I Murderer    It was, so please your highness.
        Macbeth                                     Well then, now
                   Have you considered of my speeches?  Know
                   That it was he, in the times past, which held you
                   So under fortune, which, you thought, had been
                   Our innocent self.  This I made good to you
                   In our last conference; passed in probation with you
3180               How you were borne in hand; how crossed; the instruments;
                   Who wrought with them; and all things else, that might
                   To half a soul, and to a notion crazed,
                   Say, "Thus did Banquo".
     I Murderer                             You made it known to us.
        Macbeth    I did so; and went further, which is now
                   Our point of second meeting.  Do you find
                   Your patience so predominate in your nature
                   That you can let this go?  Are you so gospelled
                   To pray for this good man, and for his issue,
                   Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave
                   And beggared yours for ever?
3190 I Murderer                                  We are men, my liege.
        Macbeth    Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
                   As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
                   Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept
                   All by the name of dogs: the valued file
                   Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
                   The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
                   According to the gift which bounteous nature
                   Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
                   Particular addition, from the bill
31100              That writes them all alike; and so of men.
                   Now, if you have a station in the file,
                   Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it;
                   And I will put that business in your bosoms,
                   Whose executions takes your enemy off,
                   Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
                   Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
                   Which in his death were perfect.
     2 Murderer                                     I am one, my liege.
                   Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
                   Have so incensed, that I am reckless what
                   I do to spite the world.
     I Murderer                              And I another,        31110
                   So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,
                   That I would set my life on any chance
                   To mend it or be rid on 't.
        Macbeth                                 Both of you
                   Know Banquo was your enemy.
 Both Murderers                                 True, my lord.
        Macbeth    So is he mine; and in such bloody distance
                   That every minute of his being thrusts
                   Against my near'st of life; and though I could
                   With bare-faced power sweep him from my sight,
                   And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
31120              For certain friends, that are both his and mine,
                   Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
                   Who I myself struck down: and thence it is
                   That I to your assistance do make love,
                   Masking the business from the common eye,
                   For sundry weighty reasons.
     2 Murderer                                 We shall, my lord,
                   Perform what you command us.
     I Murderer                                  Though our lives--
        Macbeth    Your spirits shine through you.  Within this hour at most
                   I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
                   Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
31130              The moment on 't, for  't must be done tonight
                   And something from the palace; always thought
                   That I require a clearness: and with him
                   (To leave no rubs, nor botches, in the work),
                   Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
                   Whose absence is no less material to me
                   Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
                   Of that dark hour.  Resolve yourselves apart;
                   I 'll come to you anon.
     2 Murderer                             We are resolved, my lord.
        Macbeth    I 'll call upon you straight: abide within.--

                               Exeunt Murderers.

31140              It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul's flight,
                   If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.


                                   Scene ii

                           The same.  Another room.

                       Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.


321Lady Macbeth    Is Banquo gone from court?
        Servant    Ay, Madam, but returns again tonight.
   Lady Macbeth    Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
                   For a few words.
        Servant                      Madam, I will.

                                                                                  Exit.

   Lady Macbeth    Nought 's had, all 's spent,
                   Where our desire is got without content:
                   'T is safer to be that which we destroy,
                   Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

                                 Enter Macbeth

                   How now, my lord?  Why do you keep alone,
                   Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
3210               Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
                   With them they think on?  Things without all remedy
                   Should be without regard: what 's done is done.
        Macbeth    We have scotched the snake, not killed it:
                   She 'll close and be herself; whilst our poor malice
                   Remains in danger of her former tooth.
                   But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
                   Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
                   In the affliction of these terrible dreams
                   That shake us nightly.  Better be with the dead
3220               Whom we, to gain our place, have sent to peace,
                   Than on the torture of the mind to lie
                   In restless ecstasy.  Duncan is in his grave;
                   After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
                   Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
                   Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
                   Can touch him further.
   Lady Macbeth                            Come on;
                   Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
                   Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
        Macbeth    So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.
3230               Let your remembrance apply to Banquo:
                   Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
                   Unsafe the while, that we
                   Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,
                   And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
                   Disguising what they are.
   Lady Macbeth                               You must leave this.
        Macbeth    O! full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
                   Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.
   Lady Macbeth    But in them nature's copy 's not eterne.
        Macbeth    There 's comfort yet; they are assailable:
3240               Then be thou jocund.  Ere the bat hath flown
                   His cloistered flight; ere to black Hecate's summons
                   The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,
                   Hath run night's yawning peal,
                   There shall be done a deed of dreadful not.
   Lady Macbeth    What 's to be done?
        Macbeth    Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
                   Till thou applaud the deed.  Come, seeling Night,
                   Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
                   And, with thy bloody and invisible hand,
3250               Cancel, and tear to pieces, that great bond
                   Which keeps me pale!--light thickens; and the crow
                   Makes wing to the rooky wood;
                   Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
                   Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse,
                   Thou marvellest at my words: but hold thee still;
                   Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
                   So, pr'ythe, go with me.

                                    Exeunt.


                                   Scene iii

                                   The same.

                  A park, with a road leading to the palace.


                            Enter three Murderers.

331  I Murderer    But who did bid thee join with us?
     3 Murderer                                        Macbeth.
     2 Murderer    He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
                   Our offices, and what we have to do,
                   To the direction just.
     I Murderer                           Then stand with us.
                   The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
                   Now spurs the lated traveller apace,
                   To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
                   The subject of our watch.
     3 Murderer                               Hark, I hear horses.
                   [Within]
         Banquo    Give us a light there, ho!
     2 Murderer                                Then 't is he; the rest
3310               That are within the note of expectation
                   Already are i' the court.
     I Murderer                               His horses go about.
     3 Murderer    Almost a mile, but he does usually,
                   So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
                   Make it their walk.

                   Enter Banquo, and Fleance, with a torch.

     2 Murderer                          A light, a light!
     3 Murderer                                             'T is he.
     I Murderer    Stand to 't.
                   [To Fleance]
         Banquo                 It will be rain tonight.
     I Murderer                                           Let it come down.

                   The First Murderer strikes out the light
                        while the others assault Banquo

         Banquo    O, treachery!  Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
                   Thou mayest revenge--[To the Murderer] O slave!

                            Dies. Fleance escapes.

     3 Murderer    Who did strike out the light?
     I Murderer                                   Was 't not the way?
     3 Murderer    There 's but one down: the son is fled.
3320 2 Murderer                                          We have lost the
                   Best half of our affair.
     I Murderer    Well, let 's away, and say how much is done.

                                    Exeunt.


                                   Scene iv

                        A room of state in the palace.

                              A banquet prepared.

                         Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth,
                      Ross, Lenox, Lords, and Attendants.


341     Macbeth    You know your own degrees, sit down: at first and last,
                   The hearty welcome.
          Lords                        Thanks to your majesty.
        Macbeth    Ourself will mingle with society,
                   And play the humble host.
                   Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
                   We will require her welcome.
   Lady Macbeth    Pronounce it for me, Sir, to allour friends;
                   For my heart speaks, they are welcome.

                       Enter First Murderer to the door.

                   [To Lady Macbeth]
        Macbeth    See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
                   [To the Company]
3410               Both sides are even: here I 'll sit i' the midst.
                   Be large in mirth; anon, we 'll drink a measure
                   The table round.  [To the Murderer]
                                     There 's blood upon thy face.
       Murderer    'T is Banquo's then.
        Macbeth    'T is better thee without, than he within.
                   Is he dispatched?
       Murderer    My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
        Macbeth    Thou art the best o' the cut-throats; ywt he 's good
                   That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
                   Thou art the nonpareil.
       Murderer                             Most royal Sir,
3420               Fleance is 'scaped.
                   [Aside]
        Macbeth    Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;
                   Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
                   As broad and general as the casing air:
                   But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in
                   To saucy doubts and fears.--[To the Murderer]
                                                But Banquo's safe?
       Murderer    Ay, my good lord, safe in a ditch he bides,
                   With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
                   The least a death to nature.
        Macbeth                                  Thanks for that.--
                   [Aside]
                   There the grown serpent lies: the worm, that 's fled,
3430               Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
                   No teeth for the present.--[To the Murderer]
                                              Get thee gone; tomorrow
                   We 'll hear ourselves again.

                                Exit Murderer.

   Lady Macbeth                                   My royal lord,
                   You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
                   That is not often vouched, while 't is a-making,
                   'T is given with welcome.  To feed were best at home.
                   From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;
                   Meeting were bare without it.
        Macbeth                                   Sweet remembrancer!
                   Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
                   And health on both!
          Lenox                         May it please your sit?
3440    Macbeth    Here had we now our country's honour roofed,
                   Were the graced person of our Banquo present;

                         [The Ghost of Banquo enters,
                         and sits in Macbeth's place.]

                   Who may I rather challange for unkindness,
                   Than pity for mischance!
           Ross                               His abscence, Sir,
                   Lays blame upon his promise.  Please 't your highnes
                   To grace us with your royal company?
        Macbeth    The table 's full.
          Lenox                        Here is a place reserved, Sir.
        Macbeth    Where?
          Lenox            Here, my good lord. [Macbeth notices the Ghost]
                                                What is 't that moves your
                                                                [highness?
        Macbeth    Which of you have done this?
          Lords                                   What, my good lord?
        Macbeth    [To the Ghost]
3450               Thou canst not say I did it.  Never shake
                   Thy gory locks at me.
           Ross    Gentlemen, rise; his highness is not well.
   Lady Macbeth    Sit, worthy friends.  My lord is often thus,
                   And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
                   The fit is momentary; upon a thought
                   He will again be well.  If much you note him
                   You shall offend him, and extend his passion;
                   Feed, and regard him not.--[To Macbeth] Are you a man?
        Macbeth    Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
                   which might appal the devil.
   Lady Macbeth                                  O proper stuff!     3460
                   This is the very painting of your fear:
                   This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
                   Led you to Duncan. O! these flaws and starts
                   (Imposters to true fear) would well become
                   A woman's story at a winter's fire,
                   Authorised by her grandam.  Shame itself!
                   Why do you make such faces?  When all 's done,
                   You look but on a stool.
        Macbeth    [To the Lords]
                   Pr'ythee, see there! behold! lo! how say you?
                   Why, what care I?
                                     [to the Ghost]
3470                                 If thou canst nod, speak too.--
                   [To the Lords]
                   If charnel-houses and our graves must send
                   Those that we bury back, our monuments
                   Shall be the maws of kites.

                               Ghost disappears.

   Lady Macbeth                                 What! quite unmanned in folly?
        Macbeth    If I stand here, I saw him.
   Lady Macbeth                                 Fie! for shame!
        Macbeth    Blood hath been shed ere now, i' th' olden time,
                   Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
                   Ay, and since too, murders have been performed
                   Too terrible for the ear: the time has been
                   That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
3480               And there an end; but now they rise again,
                   With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
                   And push us from our stools.  This is more strange
                   Than such a murder is.
   Lady Macbeth                            My worthy lord,
                   Your noble friends do lack you.
        Macbeth                                    I do forget.--
                   Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends;
                   I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
                   To those that know me.  Come, love and health to all;
                   Then, I 'll sit down.--Give me some wine: fill full:--
                   I drink to the general joy of the whole table,
3490               And to our dearest friend Banquo, whom we miss;
                   Would he were here.

                                Re-enter Ghost

                                        To all, and him, we thirst,
                   And all to all.
          Lords                     Our duties, and the pledge.
        Macbeth    [To the Ghost]
                   Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
                   Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
                   Thou hast no speculation in those eyes,
                   Which thou dost glare with.
   Lady Macbeth    [To the Lords]              Think of this, good peers,
                   But as a thing of custom: 't is no other;
                   Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
        Macbeth    What man dare, I dare:
34100   Approach    thou like the rugged Russian bear,
                   The armed rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
                   Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
                   Shall never tremble: or, be alive again,
                   And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
                   If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
                   The baby of a girl.  Hence, horrible shadow!
                   Unreal mockery, hence!--

                               Ghost disappears.

                                             Why, so;--being gone,
                   I am a man again.--Pray you, sit still.
   Lady Macbeth    You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
                   With most admired disorder.
34110   Macbeth                                 Can such things be,
                   And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
                   Without our special wonder?  You make me strange
                   Even to the disposition that I owe,
                   When now I think you can behold such sights,
                   And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
                   When mine is blanched with fear.
           Ross                                      What sights, my lord?
   Lady Macbeth    [To the Lords]
                   I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
                   Question enrages him.  At once, good night:--
                   Stand not upon the order of your going,
                   But go at once.
34120     Lenox                    Good night, and better health
                   Attend his majesty!
   Lady Macbeth                         A kind good night to all.

                         Exeunt Lords and Attendants.

        Macbeth    It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood:
                   Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak;
                   Augurs, and understood relations, have
                   By magot-pies and choughs, and rooks, brought forth
                   The secret'st man of blood.  What is the night?
   Lady Macbeth    Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
        Macbeth    How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
                   At our great bidding?
   Lady Macbeth                           Did you send to him, Sir?
34130   Macbeth    I hear it by the way; but I will send
                   There 's not a one of them, but in his house
                   I keep a servant fee'd.  I will tomorrow
                   (And betimes I will) to the weird sisters:
                   More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
                   Byt the worst means, the worst.  For mine own good
                   All causes shall give way:  I am in blood
                   Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more,
                   Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
                   Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
34140              Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
   Lady Macbeth    You lack the season fo all natures, sleep.
        Macbeth    Come, we 'll to sleep.  My strange and self-abuse
                   Is the initiate fear, that wants hard use:
                   We are yet but young in deed.

                                    Exeunt.


                                    Scene v

                                  The Heath.

              Thunder.  Enter the Three Witches, meeting Hecate.


351     I Witch    Why, how now, Hecate? you look angrily.
         Hecate    Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
                   Saucy, and overbold?  How did you dare
                   To trade and traffic with Macbeth,
                   In riddles, and affairs of death;
                   And I, the mistress of your charms,
                   The close contriver of all harms,
                   Was never called to bear my part,
                   Or show the glory of our art?
3510               And, which is worse, all you have done
                   Hath been for for a wayward son,
                   Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,
                   Loves for his own ends, not for you.
                   But make ammends now: get you gone,
                   And at the pit of Acheron
                   Meet me i' the morning: thither he
                   Will come to know his destiny.
                   Your vessels and your spells provide,
                   Your charms, and everything beside.
3520               I am for the air; this night I 'll spend
                   Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
                   Great business must be wrought ere noon.
                   Upon the corner of the moon
                   There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
                   I 'll catch it ere it come to ground:
                   And that, distilled by the magic sleights,
                   Shall raise such artificial sprites,
                   As, by the strength of their illusion,
                   Shall draw him on to his confusion.
3530               He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
                   His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear;
                   And you all know, security
                   Is mortals' chiefest enemy.

                  Song, within: "Come away, come away," etc.

                   Hark!  I am called: my little spirit, see,
                   Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.

                                     Exit.

        I Witch    Come, let 's make haste: she 'll soon be back again.

                                   Scene vi

                            Somewhere in Scotland.

                         Enter Lenox and another Lord.


361       Lenox    My former speeches have hit your thoughts,
                   Which can interpret farther: only, I say,
                   Things have been strangely borne.  The gracious Duncan
                   Was pitied of Macbeth:--marry, he was dead;--
                   And the right-valiant Banquo walked too late;
                   Whom, you may say, if 't please you, Fleance killed,
                   For Fleance fled.  Men must not walk too late.
                   Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
                   It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
3610               To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
                   How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,
                   In pious rage, the two delinquents tear,
                   That were the slaves of drink, and thralls of sleep?
                   Was not that nobly done?  Ay, and wisely, too;
                   For 't would have angered any heart alive
                   To hear the men deny 't.  So that, I say,
                   He has borne all things well; and I do think
                   That, had he Duncan's sons under his key
                   (As, an 't please Heaven, he shall not), they should find
3620               What 't were to kill a father; so should Fleance.
                   But, peace!--for from broad words, and 'cause he failed
                   His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
                   Macduff lives in disgrace.  Sir, can you tell
                   Where he bestows himself?
          Lord                                The son of Duncan
                   From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
                   Lives in the English court; and is received
                   Of the most pious Edward with such grace,
                   That the malevolence of fortune nothing
                   Takes from his high respect.  Thither Macduff
3630               Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid,
                   To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seward;
                   That, by the help of these (with Him above
                   To ratify the work), we may again
                   Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
                   Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,
                   All which we pine for now.  And this report
                   Hath so exasperate the king that he
                   Prepares for some attempt of war.
         Lenox                                        Send he to Macduff?
3640      Lord     He did: and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"
                   The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
                   And hums, as who should day, "You 'll rue the time
                   That clogs me with this answer."
         Lenox                                       And that well might
                   Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
                   His wisdom can provide.  Some holy angel
                   Fly to the court of England, and unfold
                   His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
                   May soon return to this our suffering country
                   Under a hand accursed!
          Lord                             I 'll send my prayers with him.

                                    Exeunt.

           I Witch      Round about the cauldron go;
                        In the poisoned entrails throw.--

                        In the cauldron boil and bake;
                        Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
                        Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
                        Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,
                        Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing,
                        For a charm of powerful trouble,
                        Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
4120           All      Double, double, toil and trouble:
                        Fire, burn; and cauldron, trouble.

                        Witches' mummy: maw, and gulf,
                        Of the ravined salt-sea shark;
                        Toot of hemlock, digged i' th' dark;
                        Liver of blaspheming Jew;
                        Gall of goat, and slips of yew
                        Slivered in the moon's eclipse;
                        Nose of Trk, and Tartar's lips;
4130                    Finger of birth-strangled babe,
                        Ditch-delivered by a drab,
                        Make the gruel thick and slab:
                        Add thereto a tiger's chaudron
                        For th' ingredients of our cauldron.
               All      Double, double, toil and trouble:
                        Fire, burn; and, cauldron bubble.
           2 Witch      Cool it with a baboon's blood:
                        Then the charm is firm and good.

                                Enter Hecate

            Hecate      O, well done!  I commend your pains,
4140                    And every one shall share i' th' gains.
                        And now about the cauldron sing,
                        Like elves and fairies in a ring,
                        Enchanting all that you put in.

                                 Exit Hecate.

                        What is 't you do?
               All                          A deed without a name.

                        Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
                        Though you untie the winds, and let them fight

                        Confound and swallow navigation up;
                        Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down;
                        Though castles topple on their wardens' heads;
                        Though palaces and pyramids do slope
                        Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
                        Of nature's germen tumble all together,

                        To what I ask you.
           I Witch                          Speak.

           I Witch      Say, if thou 'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
                        Or from our masters.
           Macbeth                            Call 'em; let me see 'em.

                        From the murderer's gibbet, throw
                        Into the flame.

                        Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
      I Apparition      Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
                        Beware the Thane of Fife.--Dismiss me.--Enough.

           Macbeth      Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks:
                        Thou hast harped my fear aright.  But one word more:--
           I Witch      He will not be commanded.  Here 's another,
                        More potent than the first.

4180                    The power of man, for none of woman born
                        Shall harm Macbeth.

           Macbeth      Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
                        But yet I 'll make assurance double sure,
                        And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
                        That I may tell pale-hearted Fear it lies.

                        Shall come against him.

           Macbeth                              That will never be;

                        Our duties did his welcome pay.

                [Music. The Witches dance, and vanish with Hecate.]

           Macbeth      Where are they?  Gone?--Let this pernicious hour
                        Stand aye accursed in the calendar!--
                        Come in, without there!

                                  Enter Lenox

             Lenox                               What 's your grace's will?
           Macbeth      Saw you the weird sisters?
             Lenox                                  No, my lord.
           Macbeth      Came they not by you?
             Lenox                             No, indeed, my lord.
           Macbeth      Infected be the air whereon they ride;
                        And damned all those that trust them!--I did hear
41140                   The galloping of horse: who was 't came by?
             Lenox      'T is two or three, my lord, that bring you word,
                        Macduff is fled to England.
           Macbeth                                   Fled to England?
             Lenox      Ay, my good lord.
           Macbeth      [Aside.]
                        Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:
                        The flighty purpose never is o'ertook,
                        Unless the deed go with it.  From this moment
                        The very firstlings of my heart shall be
                        The firstlings of my hand.  And even now,
                        To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
                        The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
41150                   Seize upon Fife; give to th' edge o' th' sword
                        His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
                        That trace him in his line.  No boasting, like a fool;
                        This deed I 'll do, before this purpose cool:
                        But no more sights!--[To Lenox]
                                             Where are these gentlemen?
                        Come, bring me where they are.

                                                                                                  Exeunt.


                                   Scene II

                                     Fife.

                          A room in Macduff's castle.


                     Enter Lady Macduf, her son, and Ross.

421   Lady Macduff      What had he done, to make him fly the land?
              Ross      You must have patience, madam.
       Lady Macduff                                      He had none:
                        His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
                        Our fears do make us traitors.
               Ross                                    You know not
                        Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
       Lady Macduff     Wisdom? to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
                        His mansion, and his titles, in a place
                        From whence himself does fly?  He loves us not:
                        He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
4210                    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
                        Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
                        All is the fear, and nothing is the love;
                        All little is the wisdom, where the flight
                        So runs against all reason.
              Ross                                   My dearest coz,
                        I pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband,
                        He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
                        The fits o' th' season.  I dare not speak much further:
                        But cruel are the times, when we are traitors,
                        And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour
4220                    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
                        But float upon a wild and violent sea
                        Each way, and move--I take my leave of you:
                        Shall not be long but I 'll be here again.
                        Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
                        To what they were before.--[To her Son.]
                                                   My, pretty, cousin,
                        Blessing upon you.
      Lady Macduff       Fathered he is, and yet he 's fatherless.
              Ross      I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
                        It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
4230                    I take my leave at once

                                                                                                        Exit.

      Lady Macduff      [To her Son]
                        Sirrah, your father 's dead,
                        And what will you do now?  How will you live?
               Son      As birds do, mother.
      Lady Macduff                              What, with worms and flies?
               Son      With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
      Lady Macduff      Poor bird! thou 'dst never fear the net, nor lime,
                        The pit-fall, nor the gin?
               Son                                 Why should I, mother?
                        Poor birds they are not set for.
                        My father is not dead, for all your saying.
      Lady Macduff      Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?
4240           Son      Nay, how will you do for a husband?
      Lady Macduff      Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
               Son      Then you 'll buy 'em to sell again.
      Lady Macduff      Thou speakest with all thy wit;
                        And yet, i' faith, with wit enough for thee.
               Son      Was my father a traitor, mother?
      Lady Macduff      Ay, that he was.
               Son      What is a traitor?
      Lady Macduff      Why, one that swears and lies.
               Son      And be all traitors that do so?
4250  Lady Macduff      Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
               Son      And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
      Lady Macduff      Every one.
               Son      Who must hang them?
      Lady Macbeth      Why, the honest men.
               Son      Then the liars and swearers are fools; for there are liars
                        and swearers enow to beat the honest men, and hang up them.
      Lady Macduff      Now God help thee, poor monkey!  But how wilt thou do for a
                        father?
               Son      If he were dead, you 'ld weep for him: if you would not, it
4260                    were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.
      Lady Macduff      Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

                              Enter a Messenger.

         Messenger      Bless you, fair dame!  I am not to you known,
                        Though in you state of honour I am perfect.
                        I doubt, some danger does approach you nearly:
                        If you will take a homely man's advice,
                        Be not found here; hence, with you little ones.
                        To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
                        To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
                        Which is noo nigh your person.  Heaven preserve you!
                        I dare abide no longer.
4270  Lady Macduff                               Whither should I fly?
                        I have done no harm,  But I remember now
                        I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
                        Is often laudable, to so good sometime
                        Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
                        Do I put up that womanly defence,
                        To say, I have done no harm?  What are these faces?

                               Enter Murderers.

       I Murderer       Where is your husband?
     Lady Macduff       I hope, in no place so unsanctified,
                        Where such as thou may'st find him.
       I Murderer                                                                      He 's a traitor.
              Son       Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!
4280   I Murderer                                                                       What, you egg!

                        [Stabbing him.]
                        Young fry of treachery!
              Son                                He has killed me, mother:
                        Run away, I pray you! [Dies.]

                      Exit Lady Macduff, crying "Murder!"
                         and pursued by the Murderers.



                                   Scene III

                                    England

                         A room in the King's palace.


                          Enter Malcolm and Macduff.

431       Malcolm       Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
                        Weep our sad bosoms empty.
          Macduff                                  Let us rather
                        Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
                        Bestride our down-fall birthdom.  Each new morn,
                        New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows
                        Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
                        As if it felt with Scotland, and yelled out
                        Like syllable of dolour.
          Malcolm                                 What I believe, I 'll wail;
                        What know, believe; and what I can redress,
4310                    As I shall find the time to friend, I will
                        What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
                        This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
                        Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
                        He hath not touched you yet.  I am young; but something
                        You may derserve of him through me, and wisdom
                        To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb,
                        T' appease an angry god.
           Macduff      I am not treacherous.
           Malcolm                             But Macbeth is.
                        A good and virtuous nature may recoil
4320                    In an imperial charge.  But I shall crave your pardon:
                        That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose:
                        Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:
                        Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
                        Yet grace must still look so.
           Macduff                                    I have lost my hopes.
           Malcolm      Perchance ever there, where I did find my doubts.
                        Why in that rawness left your wife and child
                        (Those precious motives, those strong knots of love)
                        Without leave-taking?--I pray you,
                        Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
4330                    But mine own safeties: you may be rightly just,
                        Whatever I shall think.
           Macduff                               Bleed, bleed, poor country!
                        Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
                        For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;
                        The title is affeered!-- Fare thee well, lord:
                        I would not be the villain that thou thinkest
                        For the whole space that 's in the tyrant's grasp,
                        And the rich East to boot.
           Malcolm                                  Be not offended:
                        I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
                        I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
4340                    It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
                        Is added to her wounds: I think, withal,
                        There would be hands uplifted in my right;
                        And here, from gracious England, have I offer
                        Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
                        When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
                        Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
                        Shall have more vices that it had before,
                        More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
                        By him that shall succeed.
           Macduff                                  What should he be?
4350       Malcolm      It is myself, I mean; in whom I know
                        All the particulars of vice so grafted,
                        That, when they shall be opened, Black Macbeth
                        Will seem as pure as a lamb, being compared
                        With my confineless harms.
           Macduff                                  Not in the legions
                        Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned
                        In evils, to top Macbeth.
           Malcolm                                I grant him bloody,
                        Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
                        Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
4360                    That has a name; but there 's no bottom, none,
                        In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
                        Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
                        The cister of my lust; and my desire
                        All continent impediments would o'erbear,
                        That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
                        Than such an one to reign.
           Macduff                                  Boundless intemperance
                        In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
                        Th' untimely emptying of the happy throne,
                        And fall of many kings.  But fear not yet
4370                    To take upon you what is yours; you may
                        Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
                        And yet seem cold--the time you may so hoodwink:
                        We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
                        That vulture in you, to devour so many
                        As will to greatness dedicate themselves.
                        Finding it so inclined.
           Malcolm                               With this, there grows
                        In my most ill-composed affection such
                        A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,
                        I should cut off the nobles for their land;
4380                    Desire his jewels, and this other's house;
                        And my more-having would be as a sauce
                        To make me hunger more, that I should forge
                        Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
                        Destroying them for wealth.
           Macduff                                   This avarice
                        Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
                        Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
                        The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
                        Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
                        Of your mere own.  All these are portable,
4390                    With other graces weighed.
           Malcolm      But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
                        As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
                        Bounty,perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
                        Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
                        I have no relish of them; but abound
                        In the division of each of several crime,
                        Acting it many ways.  Nay, had I power, I should
                        Uproar the universal peace, confound
                        All unity on earth.
43100      Macduff                           O Scotland! Scotland!
           Malcolm      If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
                        I am as I have spoken.
           Macduff                              Fit to govern?
                        No, not to live.--O nation miserable!
                        With an untitled tyrant, bloody-sceptered,
                        When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
                        Since that the truest issue of thy throne
                        By his own interdiction stands accused,
                        And does blaspheme his breed?  Thy royal father
                        Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
43110                   Oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet,
                        Died every day she lived.  Fare thee well!
                        These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
                        Hath banished me from Scotland.--O my breast,
                        Thy hope ends here!
           Malcolm                           Macduff, this noble passion,
                        Child of integrity, hath from my soul
                        Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
                        To thy good truth and honour.  Devilish Macbeth
                        By many of these trains hath sought to win me
                        Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
43120                   From over-crdedulous haste: but God above
                        Deal between thee and me! for even now
                        I put myself to thy direction, and
                        Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
                        The taints and blames I laid upon myself
                        For strangers to my nature.  I am yet
                        Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;
                        Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;
                        At no time broke my faith: would not betray
                        The devil to his fellow; and delight
43130                   No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
                        Was this upon myself.  What I am truly
                        Is thine, and my poor country's to command:
                        Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,
                        Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
                        Already at a point, was setting forth.
                        Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
                        Be like our warranted quarrel!  Why are you silent?
           Macduff      Such welcome and unwelcome things at once,
                        'T is hard to reconcile.

                                Enter a Doctor.

           Malcolm                                 Well, more anon.
                        [To the Doctor]
43140                   Comes the king forth, I pray you?
            Doctor      Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
                        That stay his cure: their malady convinces
                        The great assay of art; but, at his touch
                        Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,
                        They presently amend.
           Malcolm                            I thank you, doctor.

                                                                                          Exit Doctor.

           Macduff      What 's the disease he means?
           Malcolm                                    'T is called the evil:
                        A most miraculous work in this good king,
                        Which often, since my here-remain in England,
                        I have seen him do.  How he solicits heaven,
43150                   Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
                        All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
                        The mere despair of surgery, he cures;
                        Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
                        Put on with holy prayers: and 't is spoken,
                        To the succeeding royalty he leaves
                        The healing benediction.  With this strange virtue
                        He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;
                        And sundry blessings hang about his throne
                        That speak him full of grace.

                                  Enter Ross

           Macduff                                     See, who comes here.
43160      Malcolm      My countryman; but yet I know him not.
           Macduff      My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
           Malcolm      I know him now.  Good God betimes remove
                        The means that makes us stranges!
              Ross                                         Sir, amen.
           Macduff      Stands Scotland where it did?
              Ross                                     Alas, poor country!
                        Almost afraid to know itself.  It cannot
                        Be called our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
                        But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
                        Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rend the air
                        Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems
43170                   A modern ecstasy: the dead man's knell
                        Is there scarce asked for who; and good men's lives
                        Expire before the flowers in their caps,
                        Dying or ere they sicken.
          Macduff                                 O relation
                        Too nice and yet too true!
          Malcolm                                  What 's the newest grief?
             Ross       That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;
                        Each minute teems a new one.
          Macduff                                    How does my wife?
             Ross       Why, well.
          Macduff                  And all my children?
             Ross                                        Well, too.
          Macduff       The tyrant has not battered at their peace?
             Ross       No: they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
43180     Macduff       Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes 't?
             Ross       When I came hither to transport the tidings,
                        Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
                        Of many worthy fellows that were out;
                        Which was, to my belief, witnessed the rather,
                        For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
                        Now is the time of help.  Your eye in Scotland
                        Would create soldiers, make our women fight
                        To doff their dire distresses.
          Malcolm       Be 't their comfort,
                        We are coming thither.  Gracious England hath
43190                   Lent us good Siward, and ten thousand me;
                        An older and a better soldier none
                        That christendom gives out.
             Ross                                    Would I could answer
                        This comfort with the like!  But I have words
                        That would be howled out in the desert air,
                        Where hearing should not latch them.
          Macduff                                             What concern they?
                        The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
                        Due to some some single breast?
             Ross                                       No mind that 's honest
                        But in it share some woe, though the main part
                        Pertains to you alone.
          Macduff                              If it be mine,
43200                   Keep it not from me; quickly let me have it.
             Ross       Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
                        Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
                        That ever yet they heard.
          Macduff                                 Humph!  I guess at it.
             Ross      Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
                        Savagely slaughtered: to relate the manner
                        Were, on the quarry of these murdered deer,
                        To add the death of you.
          Malcolm                                Merciful heaven!--
                        What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows:
                        Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak
43210                   Whispers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it break.
          Macduff       My children too?
             Ross                         Wife, children, servants, all
                        That could be found.
          Macduff                            And I must be from thence!
                        My wife killed too?
             Ross                            I have said.
          Malcolm                                                                   Be comforted:
                        Let 's make us medicines of our great revenge,
                        To cure this deadly grief.
          Macduff       He has no children.--all my pretty ones?
                        Did you say all?--O hell-kite!--All?
                        What, all my pretty chickens, and their dam,
                        At one fell swoop?
          Malcolm       Dispute it like a man.
43220     Macduff                               I shall do so;
                        But I must also feel it as a man:
                        I cannot but remember such things were,
                        That were most precious to me.--Did heaven look on,
                        And would not take their part?  Sinful Macduff!
                        They were all struck for thee.  Naught that I am,
                        Not for their own demerits, but for mine
                        Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!
           Malcolm      Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
                        Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
43230      Macduff      O! I could play the woman with mine eyes,
                        And braggart with my tongue.--But, gentle heavens,
                        Cut short all intermission; front to front
                        Being thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
                        Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
                        Heaven forgive him too!
           Malcolm                              This time goes manly,
                        Come, go we to the King: our power is ready;
                        Our lack is nothing but our leave.  Macbeth
                        Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
                        Put on their instruments.  Receive what cheer you may;
43240                   The night is long that never finds the day.

                                                                     Exeunt.

                                   Scene i

                                  Dunsinane

                            A room in the castle.

            Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.


511      Doctor    I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
                   no truth in your report.  When was it she last walked?
    Gentlewoman    Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her
                   rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock
                   her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon 't,
                   read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed;
                   yet all the while in a most fast sleep.
         Doctor    A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the
                   benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching!  In
                   this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other
                   actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard
5110               you say?
    Gentlewoman    That, sir, which I will not report after her.
         Doctor    You may to me; and 't is most meet you should.
    Gentlewoman    Neither to you, nor any one, having no witness to confirm
                   my speech.

                             Enter Lady Macbeth, with a taper.

                   Lo you! here she comes.  This is her very guise, and upon
                   my life, fast asleep.  Observe her: stand close.
         Doctor    How came she by that light?
    Gentlewoman    Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually:
                   't is her command.
5120     Doctor    You see, her eyes are open.
    Gentlewoman    Ay, but their sense are shut.
         Doctor    What is it she does now?  Look, how she rubs her hands.
    Gentlewoman    It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing
                   her hands.  I have known her continue in this a quarter of
                   an hour.
   Lady Macbeth    Yet here 's a spot.
         Doctor    Hark! she speaks.  I will set down what comes from her,
                   to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
   Lady Macbeth    Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One; two; why, then 't is
                   time to do 't--Hell is murky.--Fie, my Lord, fie! a
                   soldier, and afeard?--What need we fear who knows it,
5130               when none can call our power to account?--Yet who
                   would have thought the old man to have so much blood
                   in him?
         Doctor    Do you mark that?
   Lady Macbeth    The Thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--What,
                   will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o' that,
                   my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this
                   starting.
         Doctor    Go to, go to: you have known what you should not.
    Gentlewoman    She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that:
                   heaven knows what she has known.
   Lady Macbeth    Here 's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
5140               of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.  Oh! oh! oh!
         Doctor    What a sigh is there!  The heart is sorely charged.
    Gentlewoman    I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
                   dignity of the whole body.
         Doctor    Well, well, well--
    Gentlewoman    Pray God it be, sir.
         Doctor    This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known
                   those which have walked in their sleep, who have died
                   holily in their beds.
   Lady Macbeth    Wash your hands, put on your night-gown; look not so pale.
5150              --I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried: he cannot come out
                   on 's grave.
         Doctor    Even so?
   Lady Macbeth    To bed, to bed: there 's knocking at the gate.  Come,
                   come, come, come, give me your hand.  What 's done
                   cannot be undone.  To bed, to bed, to bed.

                                                                     Exit.

         Doctor    Will she go to bed now?
    Gentlewoman    Directly.
         Doctor    Foul whisp'rings are abroad.  Unnatural deeds
5160               Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
                   To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
                   More needs she the divine than the physician.--
                   God, God forgive us all!  Look after her;
                   Remove from her the means of all annoyance.
                   And still keep eyes upon her.--So, good-night:
                   My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
                   I think, but dare not speak.
    Gentlewoman                                  Good-night, good doctor.

                                                                    Exeunt.


                                   Scene ii

                         The country near Dunsinane.

                        Enter, with drums and colours,
                Menteth, Cathness, Angus, Lenox, and Soldiers.



521     Menteth    The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
                   His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
                   Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
                   Would, to the bleeding and the grim alarm,
                   Excite the mortified man.
          Angus                              Near Birnam wood
                   Shall we well meet them: that way they are coming.
       Cathness    Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
          Lenox    For certain, Sir, he is not.  I have a file
                   Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
5210               And many unrough youths, that even now
                   Protest their first of manhood.
        Menteth                                    What does the tyrant?
       Cathness    Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
                   Some say he 's mad; others, the lesser hate him,
                   Do call it valiant fury; but, for certain,
                   He cannot buckle his distempered cause
                   Within the belt of rule.
          Angus                             Now does he feel
                   His secret murders sticking on his hands;
                   Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach:
                   Those he commands move only in command,
5220               Nothing in love: now does feel his title
                   Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
                   Upon a dwarfish thief.
        Menteth                           Who then shall blame
                   His pestered senses to recoil and start,
                   When all that is within him does condemn
                   Itself for being there?
       Cathness                            Well; march we on,
                   To give obedience where 't is truly owed:
                   Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal;
                   And with him pour we, in our country's purge,
                   Each drop of us.
          Lenox                     Or so much as it needs
5230               To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
                   Make we our march towards Birnam.

                                                         Exeunt, marching.


                                  Scene iii

                                  Dunsinane

                            A room in the castle.

                   Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants.


531     Macbeth    Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
                   Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
                   I cannot taint with fear.  What 's the boy Malcolm?
                   Was he not born of woman?  The spirits that know
                   All mortal consequence have pronounced me thus:
                   "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that 's born of woman
                   Shall e'er have power upon thee."--Then fly, false thanes,
                   And mingle with the English epicures:
                   The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,
5310               Shall never sag with doubt, nor shake with fear.

                                  Enter a Servant.

                   The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
                   Where gott'st thou that goose look?
        Servant    There is ten thousand -
        Macbeth                            Geese, villain?
        Servant                                            Soldiers, sir.
        Macbeth    Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
                   Thou lily-livered boy.  What soldiers, patch?
                   Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
                   Are counsellors to fear.  What soldiers, whey-face?
        Servant    The English force, so please you.
        Macbeth    Take thy face hence.
                                                               Exit Servant.

                                        --Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
5320               When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
                   Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
                   I have lived long enough: my way of life
                   Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf;
                   And that which should accompany old age,
                   As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
                   I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
                   Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
                   Which the poor heart would fein deny, and dare not.
                   Seyton!--

                                  Enter Seyton.

         Seyton    What's your gracious pleasure?
5330    Macbeth                                   What news more?
         Seyton    All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.
        Macbeth    I 'll fight, till my bones my flesh be hacked.
                   Give me my armour.
         Seyton                        'T is not needed yet.
        Macbeth    I 'll put it on.
                   Send out more horses, skirr the country round;
                   Hang those that talk of fear.  Give me mine armour.--
                   [To the doctor.]
                   How does your patient, doctor?
         Doctor                                   Not so sick, my lord.
                   As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
                   That keep her from her rest.
5340    Macbeth                                 Cure her of that:
                   Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
                   Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
                   Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
                   And with some sweet, oblivious antidote
                   Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
                   Which weighs upon the heart?
         Doctor                                 Therein the patient
                   Must minister to himself.
        Macbeth    Throw physic to the dogs; I 'll none of it.--
                   [To Seyton.]
                   Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.--
                   Seyton, send out.--Doctor, the thanes fly from me.--
                   [To Seyton.]
5350               Come, Sir, despatch.--if thou couldst, doctor, cast
                   The water of my land, find her disease,
                   And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
                   I would applaud thee to the very echo,
                   That should applaud again.
                   [To Seyton]
                                              Pull 't off, I say.--
                   [To the Doctor.]
                   What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,
                   Would scour these English hence?--Hear'st thou of them?
         Doctor    Ay, my good lord: your royal preparation
                   Makes us hear something.
        Macbeth    [To Seyton.]
                                            Bring it after me.--
                   I will not be afraid of death and bane
5360               Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

                                                                      Exit.

         Doctor    [Aside.]
                   Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
                   Profit again should hardly draw me here.

                                                                     Exeunt.

                          Country near Dunsinane

                      Enter, with drum and colours,
                     Malcolm, old Siward and his Son,
                    Macduff, Menteth, Cathness, Angus,
                  Lenox, Rosse, and Soldiers, marching.



541     Malcolm    Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand,
                   That chambers will be safe.
        Menteth                                We doubt it nothing.
         Siward    What wood is this before us?
        Menteth                                 The wood of Birnam.
        Malcolm    Let every soldier hew him down a bough,
                   And bear 't before him: thereby shall we shadow
                   The numbers of our host, and make discovery
                   Err in report of us.
       Soldiers                         It is done.
         Siward    We learn no other but the confident tyrant
                   Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
                   Our setting down before 't.
5410    Malcolm                                'T is his main hope,
                   For where there is advantage to be gone,
                   Both more and less have given him the revolt,
                   And none serve with him but constrained things,
                   Whose hearts are absent too.
        Macduff                                 Let our just censures
                   Attend the true event, and put we on
                   Industrious soldiership.
        Siward                              The time approaches
                   That will, with due decision, make us know
                   What we shall say we have, and what we owe.
                   Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
                   But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
                   Towards which advances the war.
                                                          Exeunt, marching.

                        Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers.



551     Macbeth    Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
                   The cry is still, "They come!"  Our castle's strength
                   Will laugh a siege to scorn; here let them lie,
                   Till famine and the ague eat them up.
                   Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
                   We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
                   And bear them backward home.

                                                What is that noise?
         Seyton    It is the cry of women, my good lord.

                                                                     Exit.

        Macbeth    I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
5510               The time has been, my senses would have cooled
                   To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
                   Would, at a dismal treatise, rouse and stir,
                   As life were in 't.  I have supped full with horrors:
                   Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
                   Cannot once start me.

                                Re-enter Seyton.

                                          Wherefore was that cry?
         Seyton    The queen, my lord, is dead.
        Macbeth    She should have died hereafter:
                   There would have been a time for such a word.--
                   Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
5520               Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
                   To the last syllable of recorded time;
                   And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
                   The way to dusty death.  Out, out, brief candle!
                   Life 's but a walking shadow, a poor player
                   That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
                   And then is heard no more: it is a tale
                   Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
                   Signifying nothing.

                               Enter a Messenger.

                   Thou com'st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
5530  Messenger    Gracious my lord,
                   I should report that which I say I saw,
                   But know not how to do 't.
        Macbeth                               Well, say, sir.
      Messenger    As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
                   I looked toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
                   The wood began to move.
        Macbeth                            Liar and slave!
      Messenger    Let me endure your wrath, if 't be not so.
                   Within this three mile may you see it coming;
                   I say, a moving grove.
        Macbeth    If thou speak'st false,
                   Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
5540               Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
                   I care not if thou dost for me as much.--
                   I pull in resolution, and begin
                   To doubt th' equivocation of the fiend,
                   That lies like truth: "Fear not, till Birnam wood
                   Do come to Dunsinane";--and now a wood
                   Comes toward Dunsinane.--Arm, arm, and out!
                   If this which he avouches does appear,
                   There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
                   I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,
5550               And wish th' estate o' th' world were now undone.--
                   Ring the alarum bell!--Blow, wind! come, wrack!
                   At least we 'll die with harness on our back.

                                                                    Exeunt.



                                   Scene vi

                                   The same.

                          A plain before the castle.

                         Enter, with drum and colours,
                         Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff,
                      etc., and their army, with boughs.


561     Malcolm    Now, near enough: your leafy screens throw down,
                   And show like those you are.--
                                                   [To old Siward.]
                                                   You, worthy uncle,
                   Shall, with my cousin, your right noble son,
                   Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
                   Shall take upon 's what else remains to do
                   According to our order.
         Siward                            Fare you well.--
                   Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
                   Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
        Macduff    Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
5610               Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

                                                       Exeunt. Alarms continued.



                                 Scene vii

                                 The same.

                         Another part of the plain.

                              Enter Macbeth.



571     Macbeth    They have tied me to a stake: I cannot fly,
                   But, bear-like, I must fight the course.--What's he
                   That was not born of woman?  Such a one
                   Am I to fear, or none.

                            Enter young Siward.

   Young Siward    What is thy name?
        Macbeth    Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.
   Young Siward    No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
                   Than any is in hell.
        Macbeth                         My name 's Macbeth.
   Young Siward    The devil himself could not pronounce a title
                   More hateful to mine ear.
        Macbeth                              No, nor more fearful.
5710
   Young Siward    Thou liest, abhorred tyrant: with my sword
                   I 'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

                   [They fight, and young Siward is slain.]

        Macbeth                                       Thou wast born of woman:--
                   But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
                   Brandished by man that 's of a woman born.
                                                                    Exit.

                                   Alarms.
                                Enter Macduff.

        Macduff    The way the noise is.--[Calling to Macbeth.]
                                           Tyrant, show thy face:
                   If thou be'st slain, and with no stroke of mine,
                   My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
                   I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose arms
                   Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
                   Or else my sword, with an unbattered edge,
5720               I sheathe again undeeded.  There thou shouldst be;
                   By this great clatter, one of greatest note
                   Seems bruited. [Aside.]
                                  Let me find him, Fortune!
                   And more I beg not.

                        Enter Malcolm and old Siward.

         Siward    This way, my lord;--the castle 's gently rendered:
                   The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
                   The noble thanes do bravely in the war.
                   The day almost itself professes yours,
                   And little is to do.
        Malcolm                         We have met with foes
                   That strike beside us.
         Siward                           Enter, Sir, the castle.

                                                              Exeunt.  Alarm.



                               Scene viii

                        Another part of the field.

                             Enter Macbeth.



581     Macbeth    Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
                   On mine own sword?  Whiles I see lives, the gashes
                   Do better upon them.
        Macduff                         Turn, hell-hound, turn!
        Macbeth    Of all men else I have avoided thee:
                   But get thee back, my soul is too much charged
                   With blood of thine already.
        Macduff                                 I have no words;
                   My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
                   Than terms can give thee out!

                                 [They fight.]

        Macbeth                                  Thou losest labour:
                   As easy may'st thou the intrenchant air
5810               With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:
                   Let fall thy blade on vunerable crests:
                   I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
                   To one of woman born.
        Macduff                          Despair thy charm;
                   And let the angel whom thou still hast served
                   Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
                   Untimely ripped.
        Macbeth    Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
                   For it hath cowed my better part of man:
                   And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
5820               That palter with us in a double sense,
                   That keep the word of promise to our ear,
                   And break it to our hope.--I 'll not fight with thee.
        Macduff    Then yield thee, coward,
                   And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time:
                   We 'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
                   Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
                   "Here may you see the tyrant".
        Macbeth                                   I will not yield,
                   To kiss the ground before young Malcolm,s feet,
                   And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
5830               Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
                   And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
                   Yet I will try the last: before my body
                   I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;
                   And damned be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"

                                                 [Exeunt, fighting. Alarms.]
                                                  Re-enter fighting, and
                                                  Macbeth is slain.]




                                    Scene ix

                                Within the castle.

                               Retreat.  Flourish.
                          Enter, with drum and colours,
                Malcolm, old Siward, Rosse, Thanes and Soldiers.



591     Malcolm    I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
         Siward    Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,
                   So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
        Malcolm    Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
          Rosse    Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
                   He only lived but till he was a man;
                   The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed,
                   In the unshrinking station where he fought,
                   But like a man he died.
         Siward                            Then he is dead?
          Rosse    Ay, and brought off the field.  Your cause of sorrow
                   Must not be measured by his worth, for then
5910               It hath no end.
         Siward                    Had he his hurts before?
          Rosse    Ay, on the front.
         Siward                      Why, then, God's soldier be he!
                   Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
                   I would not wish them to a fairer death:
                   And so, his knell is knolled
        Malcolm                                 He 's worth more sorrow,
                   And that I 'll spend for him.
         Siward                                  He's worth no more;
                   They say he parted well, and paid his score:
                   And so, God be with him!--Here comes newer comfort.

                     Enter Macduff with Macbeth's head.

5920    Macduff    Hail, King! for so thou art.  Behold, where stands
                   Th' usurper's cursed: the time is free.
                   I see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl,
                   That speak my salutation in their minds;
                   Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,--
                   Hail, King of Scotland!
            All                            Hail, King of Scotland!

                                    [Flourish]

        Malcolm    We shall not spend a large expense of time
                   Before we reckon with your several loves,
                   And make us even with you.  My thanes and kinsmen,
                   Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
5930               In such an honour named.  What 's more to do,
                   Which would be planted newly with the time,--
                   As calling home our exiled friends abroad,
                   That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
                   Producing forth the cruel ministers
                   Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,
                   Who, as 't is thought, by self and violent hands
                   Took off her life;--this, and what needful else
                   That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
                   We will perform in measure, time and place.
5940               So thanks to all at once, and to each one,
                   Whom we invite to see us crownded at Scone.

                                                            Flourish.  Exeunt.
