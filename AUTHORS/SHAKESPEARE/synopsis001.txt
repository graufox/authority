         BACKGROUND. Probably first performed about 1588, this play
         was first printed in 1598. No known source has been
         discovered, though it may have been, in part,based on an
         incident related in Marguerite of Valois' Memoires.  The play
         is noteworthy in that it contains a much greater proportion
         of rhymed line than does any other Shakespearean play.

                                 -------------------

         ACT I. Ferdinand, King of Navarre, proposes to his courtiers,
         Biron, Longaville, and Dumain, that they go into a retreat
         together for three years, devoting themselves to scholarly
         pursuits. The King asks his courtiers to sign a pledge to
         live in absolute austerity. They shall see no women, shall
         fast one day a week, shall dine but once on the other days,
         shall sleep but three hours a night. Biron, though he thinks
         the terms of withdrawal too harsh, finally signs with the
         others. The King also orders that all subjects likewise
         abstain from the joys of the flesh.  The only entertainment
         the courtiers will have will be the chatter of Costard, a
         clown, and Armado, a foolish Spanish gentleman. Costard is
         the first to be found guilty of consorting a girl,
         Jaquenetta, and he is sentenced to a week's fasting in prison
         (i). Armado, who is ordered to be Costard's keeper, loves
         Jaquenetta too, and though fearful of the consequences, the
         foolish gentleman prepares to compose sonnets to her (ii).

         ACT II. Ferdinand, some time before, had lent a sum of money
         to the King of France. Now the King's daughter arrives upon a
         diplomatic mission concerning the loan. The King listens to
         her suit, which cannot be settled until the next day when
         certain papers will have arrived. He prepares a tent for her
         and her retinue outside the gates, for (because of his vow)
         he cannot admit her.  Ferdinand's courtiers immediately pair
         off with the Princess' ladies (i).

         ACT III. Armado frees Costard in order that the clown may
         carry a letter to Jaquenetta. Biron meets the messenger and
         likewise entrusts him with a letter-this one to be delivered
         to Rosiline, one of the Princess' retinue (i).

         ACT IV. Costard, of course gets the letters mixed, and the
         one for Jaquenetta is delivered to the Princess (i).
         Jaquenetta takes the letter she received to Nathaniel (a
         curate) to have it read. The pedant, Holofernes, points out
         that this letter is really from Biron to Rosiline and directs
         Jaquenetta to carry it
         to the King (ii).
             Biron conceals himself and spies upon the King as he
         reads a love poem. As Longaville enters, the King drops the
         paper and hides too.  Longaville is composing a sonnet to
         Maria, one of the Princess' ladies. As Dumain enters,
         Longaville, too hides. Dumain is composing a poem-to
         Katherine, another of the Princess' retinue. Longaville now
         accosts Dumain, and is in turn accosted by the King, who
         accuses the courtiers of breaking their oath. But Biron steps
         now steps out of hiding and accuses the King of likewise
         being in love with the Princess. Biron, however, is not long
         allowed to maintain his pretense of living up to the pledge.
         For Jaquenetta enters with Costard and brings the king
         Biron's letter to Rosaline. Now all the gentleman realize
         that each alike has broken faith. Just as wholeheartedly as
         when they had sworn asceticism, they now swear to "woo these
         girls of France." They plan an entertainment for the ladies
         in order to help further their suits (iii).

         ACT V. The gentleman approach the Princess and her court
         disguised as Russian masquers and woo the visitors, but the
         ladies have been forewarned by the spirited Boyet, have
         masked and exchanged favors so that their identities are
         confused.  Returning to their own characters the men are
         ridiculed by the ladies (ii). The minor characters have
         meanwhile prepared a "masque of the Nine Worthies" (i). When
         it is presented, it turns out to be a ridiculous failure.  At
         the height of the merriment, a messenger brings word that the
         King of France is dead. Now the ladies must leave, and they
         inform the King and his courtiers that they will not listen
         to any serious proposals for a year.  Further the King must
         retire to a monastery for that year, and Biron must use his
         wit for the benefit of sufferers in hospitals. As the ladies
         prepare to leave, it is evident that, for the present at
         least, the labors of the lovers are lost (ii).

                                   Main Characters

         ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, an identical twin to Antipholus of
             Syracuse, has been lost from his family for many years
             but is finally restored.
         ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, has spent five years searching for
             his lost brother.
         DROMIO OF EPHESUS, an identical twin to Dromio and a
             servant of Antipholus of Ephesus, is often beaten for
             mistakes of his double.
         DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, the counterpart of Dromio of Ephesus and
             the servant of Antipholus of Syracuse, likewise has
             difficulties because of mistaken identity.
         ADRIANA, the jealous wife of Antipholus of Epholus, cannot
             account for the strange actions of her supposed husband.
         LUCIANA, the sister of Adriana, finds her husband where she
             thinks herself least likely to find one.
         AEGEON, a merchant of Syracuse, finds a long-lost son.
         AEMILIA, wife of Aegeon, becomes an abbess and renounces the
             world, but finally returned to it with her husband and
             her reunited family.

         ANGELO, a goldsmith          LUCE, Adrina's  servant

                                 (PLACE: Ephesus)

         BACKGROUND. This play was probably (though not certainly)
         written about 1589 or 1590 and was first printed in 1623. Its
         chief source is the Menaechmi of Plautus, and the main plot
         follows that of earlier play quite closely. Part of one scene
         (III,i) is taken from another play by Plautus, the Amphitruo.
         The reunion of the twin's parents is probably inspired by the
         story of Apollonius of Tyre, long an English favorite.
         Shakespeare's chief addition to the play consists in adding
         the further complication of twin servants.

                                -------------------

         ACT I. Syracuse and Ephesus are enemy cities. Each has laws
         forbidding citizens of the other to enter, and those captured
         are subject to a fine of a thousand marks. Those unable to
         pay are put to death. Aegeon, a merchant of Syracuse, has
         been captured in Ephesus and is unable to pay his fine.  He
         has been brought before Solinus, ruler of the city. The Duke
         sympathizes with the unfortunate merchant but tells him that
         even he, as ruler, is powerless to break the laws of the city
         in order to free him. In answer to the Dukes questions,
         Aegeon tells his reason for being in the city. He has to
         sons, he says, who are identical twins. The sons have pairs
         of servants who are also identical twins.  Years ago one son,
         together with his mother and one of the servants, was
         separated from the rest of the family in a storm at sea. The
         remaining son, upon reaching young manhood, set out to find
         his lost brother. But after five years he had not returned.
         Aegeon, searching for the second son, has come to Ephesus and
         has, unfortunately, been captured (i).
             Meanwhile, Antipholus of Syracuse (hereafter Antipholus
         S.), who has also just arrived in Ephesus, sends his servant,
         Dromio S., with a purse of money to the inn where they have
         been staying.  Dromio of Ephesus (the identical twin of
         Dromio S.) enters and bids Antipholus S. to hurry lest he be
         late for dinner. (He thinks Antipholus S. is Antipholus E.,
         the other twin and his master.) Antipholus S. asks about the
         money, but Dromio E., of course, proclaims complete ignorance
         concerning it. Antipholus S., angered, beats him and Dromio
         E. runs away (ii).

         ACT II. Adriana, wife of Antipholus E., waits for her
         husband, who is late for dinner. Dromio E. tells her of his
         strange encounter with the man he believes to be his master.
         The waiting wife is immediately consumed with jealousy,
         imagining that another women is detaining her husband. Her
         sister, Luciana, tries to soothe her (i).
             Antipholus S. meets Dromio S. and scolds him for what he
         thinks was his servant's previous jesting. Dromio S. is of
         course, completely ignorant of the whole episode. Antipholus
         S., again angered, beats him.  Adriana enters and berates
         Antipholus S. His claim to be a stranger infuriates her all
         the more.  Finally, half thinking himself insane, Antipholus
         S. is led off to dinner (ii).

         ACT III. Before his house Antipholus E. arranges with a
         goldsmith to deliver a golden chain to his wife on the
         morrow. He berates Dromio E. for telling a wild tale about a
         purse of money and a beating he claims his master gave him.
         Antipholus E. has brought Balthazar, a merchant, home to
         dinner. Dromio S., however, will not admit them; nor will
         Adriana nor her servant, Luca Antipholus E. wishes to force
         his way in, but Balthazar dissuades him on the grounds that
         such a row will ruin his wife's reputation. They depart for
         dinner elsewhere. Antipholus E. says that he will give the
         chain he is having made to another women (i).
             Luciana chides Antipholus S. for his conduct. Antipholus
         S.  proclaims himself a total stranger to Adriana, but says
         that he loves her (Luciana).  Dromio S. enters, chattering
         that a strange and horrible women has claimed him as husband.
         Antipholus. S decides the town must be bewitched and sends
         Dromio S. to see if any ships are leaving, so that they may
         leave the frightening place. His fears seem to be borne out
         when Angelo, the goldsmith enters and insists upon his
         excepting the chain which the smith claims Antipholus has
         ordered (ii).

         ACT IV. Antipholus E. sends Dromio E. to buy a rope's end
         with which to discipline his housewife; then he meets the
         goldsmith, who asks payment for the chain. Antipholus E.
         denies having received it. Angelo needs the money to pay a
         merchant who has a claim against him. When Antipholus E.
         refuses to pay, the merchant has Angelo arrested. Angelo, in
         turn, has Antipholus E. arrested.  Dromio S. enters and tells
         Antipholus E. that he has secured passage on a boat which is
         ready to leave. Antipholus E. thinks him insane and sends him
         to Adriana for money to satisfy Angelo (i).
             Adriana and Luciana discuss the strange behavior of the
         man they believe to be Adriana's husband. Dromio S. enters
         and asks for money to redeem the arrested Antipholus E.
         (ii). The servant secures the money and takes it to
         Antipholus S. who, of course knows nothing about the
         situation. A courtesan asks Antipholus S.  for the chain,
         which she claims he has promised her in return for a ring she
         has given him. Each is convinced of the other's madness, and
         Antipholus S. is more certain than ever he is in a bewitched
         (iii).
             When Dromio E. eventually finds Antipholus E., he gives
         his master the rope's end instead of the money Antipholus E.
         expects.  Antipholus E. beats him. Adriana and Luciana
         appear, and Antipholus E berates them for locking him out of
         his house. This act, of course, they deny.  He also accuses
         them of plotting his arrest. Adriana denies his accusation
         and says that she sent Dromio with the money to free him.
         Dromio E. denies the claim. Adriana, thinking he is mad, has
         him put under restraint by Doctor Pinch and his assistants,
         after offering to pay the goldsmith. Antipholus S. and Dromio
         S.  enter, their rapiers drawn, after their doubles have been
         taken away by the doctor.  Believing that the men have
         escaped from the doctor, the ladies flee.  Antipholus S. is
         even more firmly convinced that the land is bewitched and
         tells Dromio S. that he plans to leave the city at once (iv).

         ACT V. Antipholus S. and Dromio S. meet Angelo in a street
         before a priory.  The goldsmith accosts them. He points out
         that even now Antipholus S. is wearing the chain that has
         caused so much trouble.  Antipholus S. declares that he never
         has denied that he received the chain, and challenges the
         merchant, who is accompanied Angelo and who joins with him in
         his accusation.  Adriana and Luciana cone in and plead with
         the merchant, claiming Antipholus S. is mad.  (They still
         mistake him, of course, for Antipholus E.) The abbess of the
         priory comes out and blames the supposed madness upon
         Adrianas jealous carping.  She refuses to allow Adriana to
         remove her supposed husband, and takes him into the abbey.
         The Duke enters with Aegeon, bound for the palace of
         execution. Now a messenger adds to the confusion by rushing
         in to announce the escape of the madman and his servant(i.e.,
         Antipholus E. and Dromio E.) Soon they enter, and Aegeon
         believes the pair to be his son Antipholus S. and his
         servant, Dromio S. Antipholus E. accuse his wife of locking
         him out of his own house.  Then he recounts all the evil
         things that have befallen him.  Angelo repeats his story
         about the chain, and the confusion grows deeper; for he
         confirms Antipholus E.'s story that he was locked from his
         house. Aegeon now calls on Antipholus E.. as his son to pay
         his fine and save his life.  Antipholus E. of course, does
         not recognize his father. Now the abbess comes in, with
         Antipholus S.  and Dromio S.-at last the doubles are brought
         together. The threads are immediately unwound. The twins are
         sorted out, and the abbess is disclosed as Aemilia, Aegeon's
         wife and the mother of the twins (i).

         BACKGROUND. Surmises concerning the date of the play's
         composition and performance vary from 1590 to 1592, but most
         modern critics agree in assigning if a date not later than
         1592. It is not printed until the First Folio edition of
         1623. The ultimate source is a Spanish pastoral, Diana
         Enamorada, written by Jorge de Montmayor. Shakespeare's
         immediate source a lost play, Felix and Philiomena, acted in
         1584.

         ACT I. As Valentine prepares to leave for the court of the
         Duke of Milan, he twits his friend Proteus (too much love
         with Julia to think of leaving) for remaining behind. After
         Valentine leaves, his servant, Speed, enters; and Proteus
         questions him about a letter to Julia he has asked the
         loutish servant to deliver (i). Meanwhile Lucetta has shown
         the letter to Julia, who pretends no interest; but after
         tearing up the missive in a pretended rage, she tenderly
         gathers the scraps and deciphers the message (ii).
             Now Proteus' pursuit of Julia is cut short by his father,
         who announces his plan to send Proteus (like Valentine) to
         the court of the Duke of Milan. Though Proteus pleads for an
         extension of time, hi is ordered to leave the next day (iii).

         ACT II. In Milan Valentine has also fallen in love. The
         object of this love, the fair Silvia, pretends indifference,
         but shows her interest in the young man by persuading him to
         write letters to a "friend"-a device the cunning Speed
         immediately recognizes as a mean of wooing Valentine by
         having him send letters to himself (i). Proteus arrives in
         Milan (iv), after exchanging rings with Julia as a love
         remembrance (ii). Once in Milan, however, the flighty young
         lord immediately falls in love with Valentine's sweetheart,
         Silvia (vi). Valentine asks his friend to help him elope with
         the girl (iv), but Proteus, his head filled with amorous
         ideas of his own, treacherously plans to betray the elopement
         to the Duke (her father) and to win her for himself. The
         Duke, knowing nothing of the sly young man's intentions,
         plans for her to marry Thurio, a foolish gentleman (vi).
             Now Julia, left behind in Verona, plans to follow Proteus
         to Milan, dressed as a page (vii).

         ACT III. Proteus betrays his friend by telling the Duke of
         the coming elopement. The Duke, after promising not to tell
         Valentine who has betrayed him, meets the young lover and
         tricks him into showing the Duke his letter to Silvia and the
         rope ladder he plans to use for the elopement. The Duke
         banishes Valentine, and Proteus carries his treachery further
         by consoling the heartsick youth and offering to deliver any
         letters Valentine wishes to send to Silvia (i). Proteus now
         arranges with the Duke and Thurio to slander Valentine to
         Silvia. The Duke believes that he can be trusted in such an
         assignment since his love for Julia is so well known. As part
         of his plan of deceit, Proteus suggests that Thurio push his
         own cause by writing "wailful" sonnets to Silivia (ii).

         ACT IV. In the forest, the banished Valentine is captured by
         outlaws. The youth tells them that he has been banished for
         slaying a man; and the outlaws , impressed, make him the
         captain of their band (i). Back in Milan, Proteus is having
         little success with his treacherous suit for Silvia's love.
         Julia has by now reached Milan. She hears Proteus singing
         (the famous "Who is Silvia?") and laments that Proteus no
         longer loves her. When Silvia tells Proteus that she despises
         him for his treachery, Julia listens, heartbroken (ii). In
         order to be near her faithless lover, Julia, still disguised
         as a page, enters his services, under the pseudonym,
         Sebastian. She performs the hateful task of carrying to
         Silvia her own ring (the love token she had given Proteus)
         together with a letter (iv). But Silvia has plans oh her own.
         With the aid of Eglamour,a faithful friend, she decides to
         escape to Mantus, where she has heard that Valentine is
         living (iii).

         ACT V. Silvia meets Egalamour at an abbey, and the couple
         flee (i). Her, father, the Duke, hears of her flight almost
         immediately and organizes a posse to pursue her (ii). The
         outlaw band captures Silvia (iii), but Proteus rescues her.
         Since she is still cold to him, he threatens to force her to
         his desire. Valentine, who has overheard the threat,
         confronts Proteus, who immediately admits to his error and
         begs forgiveness, which Valentine grants, after first
         generously offering to abandon his suit in favor of his
         friend. Julia, hearing Valentine's offer, faints; and the
         ring which Proteus has given her discloses her true identity.
         Proteus, repentant, reaffirms his love for Julia. The Duke
         enters with Thurio, prisoner of the outlaws. Valentine
         threatens Thurio, who hastily withdrawals his suit for
         Silvia's hand. The Duke gives all his blessing, admonishes
         Thurio for his lack of aggressiveness, and pardons the
         outlaws (iv).

         BACKGROUND. This play first printed in 1600. The date of its
         first performance has not been established exactly, but it
         was probably 1594 or 1595. The plot is original but has
         several sources from which details are drawn. These include
         Chaucer's Knight's Tale, and his Legend of Good Women;
         Plutarch's Life of Theseus; Montemayor's Diana; Ovid's
         Metamorphoses.

                                -------------------

         ACT I. Theseus, Duke of Athens, about to marry Hippolyta,
         the Queen of the Amazons, plans extensive revels to celebrate
         the occasion. He is soon disturbed, however, by a domestic
         squabble. Hermia, a fair Athenian girl, loves Lysander; but
         her father has promised her to a rival, Demetrius. The
         father, Egeus, now complains to Theseus of his daughter's
         willfulness. The Duke upholds Egeus; Hermia, he says, must
         either marry according to her father's wishes or accept one
         of two unpleasant alternatives:she must either die or "abjure
         forever the society of men."
             In order to escape this judgement, Lysander and Hermia
         plan to elope, and arrange to meet in a wood nearby.
         Unwisely, as it turns out, they confide their plans to
         Helena, who is madly in love with Demetrius, hoping to
         ingratiate herself with him (i).
             Meanwhile, a group of artisans meet to discuss their
         plans to play an "interlude" as one of the revels for the
         Duke. The actors arrange to meet the following night for
         rehearsal-their meeting place to be the same wood chosen by
         the lovers (ii).

         ACT II. In this very wood a quarrel is raging between the
         rulers of the fairies about the custody of a "changeling,"
         a little Indian boy. Titania, the Queen, has the boy and
         flatly refuses to give him up to her husband, Oberon, King of
         the Fairies. Angry with his queen, Oberon send his fairy
         jester, Robin Goodfellow, to find a flower whose juice will
         make the queen love madly the first living thing she sees
         upon awakening, "Be it lion, bear, or wolf , or bull." While
         waiting for Robin's return, Oberon overhears Demetrius and
         Helena talking. Helena has betrayed the eloping couple to
         Demetrius, who has gone in search of them. Oberon,
         overhearing him scold Helena, plans to make matters right
         between the quarreling mortals. He sends Robin to rub some of
         the magic juice upon Demetrius' eyes after the youth has gone
         to sleep (i), then goes to find Titania, who sleeps in the
         wood near where Hermia and Lysander are also sleeping. Oberon
         anoints her eyes, while Robin finds the sleeping Lysander and
         squeezes the magic juice upon him, mistaking him for
         Demetrius. Demetrius, followed by the persistent Helena,
         wanders by, and Helena awakens Lysander. Since Helena is the
         first living thing he sees upon awakening, Lysander
         immediately loves her. Leaving Hermia, he follows Helena into
         the woods (ii).

         ACT III. Robin overhears the clowns rehearsing their
         "interlude." The knavish elf enchants Bottem, changing his
         head into a donkey's. Titania awakes from her sleep nearby,
         sees Bottem, and is Hopeless;y smitten, ass's head and all
         (i). Meanwhile Hermia has wandered off in search of Lysander.
         She finds Demetrius instead and accuses him of murdering her
         lover. Robin and Oberon witness this byplay and realize that
         the sprite has mistakenly anointed the eyes of the wrong
         "Athenian youth." After Hermia leaves, Demetrius goes to
         sleep and the fairies anoint his eyes, while Oberon orders
         Robin to bring Helena so that she will be the first person
         seen by the sleeping youth when he awakens. This stratagem
         works admirably, but now both Lysander and Demetrius love
         Helena, and they begin to quarrel over her, both now spurning
         Hermia.  When the two youths leave to find a place to fight,
         Oberon orders Robin to lead them astray by false voices until
         they are so tired that they will fall asleep. The elf is then
         to apply an antidote to Lysander's eyes do that he will love
         Hermia again (ii).

         ACT IV. Oberon, who has obtained the changeling from the
         bewitched Queen, sees her sleeping with the foolish Bottem
         clasped in her arms. Pitying her, he applies the antidote to
         her eyes and removes the enchantment from Bottem's head. The
         four lovers, sleeping nearby, are discovered by Theseus,
         Hippolyta, Egeus, and a retinue, who have come to hunt in the
         woods. The angry father demands that Theseus invoke the law
         against Hermia. But when Demetrius tells Egeus that he no
         longer loves Hermia, Theseus approves the new pairing off of
         the lovers (i).

         ACT V. The three couples-Theseus and Hippolyta, Lysander and
         Hermia, Demetrius and Helena-happily gather in Theseus'
         palace to watch the wedding revels. The clowns present their
         ridiculous play, "the most lamentable comedy, and most cruel
         death of Pyramus and Thisbe." When the mortals have gone, the
         fairies dance and sing. Finally Robin Goodfellow is left to
         close with an epilogue asking the audience's approval (i)                he boy and
