         ANTONIO, the merchant of Venice, is willing to risk his life
             to help his friend's courtship.
         BASSANIO borrows Antonio's money with nearly fatal
             consequences for his friend, but chooses the right box
             and wins a bride.
         PORTIA, Bassinio's bride, shows that women can be shrewd as
             well as beautiful. She makes a skillful and convincing
             lawyer.
         GRATIANO accompanies his friend, Bassinio, to Belomont where
             he, too, finds a wife.
         LORENZO, Antonio's friend, wins Shylock's daughter for a
             bride.
         JESSICA, Shylock's daughter, deserts her father, taking a
             goodly share of his treasure with her.
         SHYLOCK, the money lender, is so bent on a bloodthirsty
             revenge that he is caught in his own trap.
         LAUNCELOT Gobbo leaves Shylock's service for Bassanio's.

         BACKGROUND. This play was first printed in 1600 but was
         probably acted between 1594 and 1597. The plot, for the most
         part, comes from a story collection. "Il Pecorone", written
         by Giovanni Fiorentino in 1378. Portia's plan for selecting
         her suitor can be traced to a story in the "Gesta Romanorum,"
         a medieval collection of tales translated in 1577. Minor
         details such as Jessica's part were  probably suggested by
         similar situations in Marlowe's "Jew of Malta"; and a lost
         play, "The Jew", mentioned by Stephen Gosson in his "School
         of Abuse" in 1579 may well have already incorporated the
         various story elements into a form roughly approximating that
         of the play as we know it.

                                ACT BY ACT ANALYSIS
                                -------------------

         ACT I. Antonio, though his own money it tied up in a shipping
         ventures, promises to help his friend Bassanio raise a large
         sum to be used in wooing the fair Portia (i). Portia's dead
         father has extracted a promise from the girl that she select
         her husband by means of a lottery in which prospective
         suitors must choose correctly from three boxes- one of gold,
         one of silver, and one of lead. None of the suitors besieging
         her pleases Portia except Bassanio (ii), who with Antonio's
         help has now arranged to borrow three thousand ducats from
         Shylock, the money lender. Despite Bassanio's protest,
         Antonio agrees to forfeit a pound of flesh if the loan plus
         interest is not repaid in time. This condition the wily
         Shylock pretends merely part of a merry jest, though he
         really hates Antonio for several reasons: Antonio is a
         Christian; Antonio lends money without interest; and Antonio
         has reviled Shylock as a usurer (iii).

         ACT II. Launcelot Gobbo leaves Shylock's service for that of
         Bassanio (ii). When he tells Shylock's daughter, Jessica,
         that he is leaving, she gives him a letter to deliver to
         Lorenzo, his new master's guest (iii). Lorenzo receives the
         letter and tells his friends that Jessica is planning to
         elope with him. He plans a masque and street parade which
         will pass her house and give her an opportunity to slip away
         (iv). When Shylock leaves home that evening to attend a
         banquet with the "prodigal Christian," he cautions Jessica to
         guard his treasures well and warns her not to watch the
         masquers who, Launcelot has told her, will pass by (v).
         Jessica, however joins the paraders, disguised as a boy, and
         succeeds in eloping with Lorenzo (vi). Since Shylock suspects
         Antonio's friends are worried about the money lender's
         reprisal when they hear rumors that Antonio's ships are being
         lost in storms (viii).
             Meanwhile, in Belmont, the Prince of Morrocco (vii) and
         the Prince of Arragon (ix) try their luck at choosing the
         right box and Portia for a bride- both fail.

         ACT III. Now Bassanio enters the lottery; he chooses the
         right box, Portia pledges her troth with the ring. Gratiano
         announces his love for Nerissa, Portia's waiting woman, and
         she accepts him (ii). Back in Venice Shylock laments his
         daughter's desertion, swearing to avenge himself upon Antonio
         if the chance presents itself. He listens carefully when his
         countryman, Tubal, brings news of mounting disasters among
         Antonio's ships (i). As the disaster multiplies, Salerio is
         sent to Belmont with a letter for Bassanio-a letter that
         tells of Antonio's total bankruptcy. Though Portia offers to
         pay twenty times the forfeit, her friends tell her that
         Shylock has already refused payment; avid to avenge upon the
         hated Christian, he insists upon his pound of flesh. In order
         to help her new husband's friend, Portia sends Bassanio with
         money to attempt, at least, to save Antonio (ii). After
         Bassanio leaves, Portia entrusts her estate to Lorenzo. She
         and Nerissa, she says, plan to "live in prayer and
         contemplation" at a nunnery until Bassanio returns. The wily
         girl then sends a letter to her cousin, Dr. Bellario, a
         learned jurist; and she and Nerissa follow their husbands to
         Venice, disguised as men (iv). While Lorenzo and Jessica pass
         the time in felicitous repose in Belmont (v), Shylock
         prepares to spring his trap upon the unfortunate Antonio. He
         taunts Antonio in the street; even the Duke, he says, cannot
         save Antonio now, since to abate the law would impeach the
         reputation of Venice for justice (iii).

         ACT IV. In court, the Duke requests mercy for Antonio, but
         Shylock is adamant: mercy does not interest him, he insists
         upon justice. Now Portia enters the case, disguised as
         Balthazar, a learned young judge, bearing a letter of
         recommendation from her cousin, Dr. Bellario. She also asks
         Shylock for mercy and offers him three times his amount due-
         still he refuses. Now Portia springs her trap. Shylock may
         have his pound of flesh she says, but if he takes one drop of
         blood, he shall lose all his hands in forfeit.
         Shylock, realizing that he is trapped, is now willing to
         accept money instead of flesh; but Portia insists that he
         shall have only the penalty if he refuses the payment.
         Furthermore, she warns, if he takes the smallest fraction too
         much or too little, he shall die and all his goods shall be
         forfeit to the state. Refused even his principal, Shylock
         attempts to slink from the court, but now Portia tells him of
         another law; it is decreed, she says, that if any alien
         attempts to take the life of a Venetian, one-half of his
         goods shall go to him upon whom the attempt was made, the
         other half to the state, and his life shall be at the mercy
         of the Duke. The Duke spares his life but takes his half of
         the estate. Antonio says that he will be content with  one-
         half of his share provided that Shylock bequeath remaining
         estate to Lorenzo at his death; but before he will grant this
         concession, he says, Shylock must become a Christian. Pressed
         to take payment for her skillful defense of Antonio, Portia
         asks for the ring she has formerly given Bassanio. Though he
         protests, Bassanio finally parts with the love token (i).
         Nerissa, also disguised, tells Portia that she will see if
         she can persuade Gratiano to part with the ring she has
         formerly given him (ii).

         ACT V. Portia and Nerissa return to Belmont, pretending that
         they are merely coming back from the nunnery. Nerissa
         upbraids Gratiano for not having the ring she gave him. Now
         Portia pretends to find that Bassanio's ring, too, is gone.
         She scolds hem first; then she and Nerissa produce the rings.
         After they tease their husbands by telling them that they had
         slept with the doctor and his clerk in return for the tokens,
         they finally reveal that Portia was the learned Doctor
         Balthazar and Nerissa his clerk (i).

         BACKGROUND. The first printed form of this play is that of
         the First Folio (1623). It was probably presented about 1594,
         though dates as early as 1592 and as late as 1602 have been
         suggested. A similar play, "The Taming of A Shrew", of
         unknown authorship, presented in 1594, is probably the
         immediate source for the play, though some scholars believe
         that the earlier play was also written by Shakespeare and
         that "A Shrew" is merely and early version of "The Shrew".

         INTRODUCTION: (A Prologue.) Christopher Sly, a vagabond
         tinker, lies dead drunk before an alehouse. A passing lord,
         seeing him there, decides a joke upon the wretch will make
         good sport. He orders his followers to scoop the fellow up,
         place him in the best bed in the lord's best room, cover him
         with jewels and surround him with servants. Bartholomew, his
         page, is to dress as a women and play "wife" to the tinker
         (i). When Sly awakens, his "servants" persuade him that he
         has slept for fifteen years. Now players whom the lord has
         engaged enter and present to Sly "The Taming of the Shrew"
         (ii).

         ACT I. Baptista, a rich Padua merchant, has two daughters.
         The elder daughter, Katherine, has a violently disagreeable
         disposition; and no suitors have appeared for her hand. But
         Baptista insists that the beautiful and amiable younger
         daughter, Bianca, shall not marry until her elder sister has
         married.  Lucentio, a newcomer to Padua, falls in love with
         Bianca at first sight and plans to gain access to her by
         posing as a schoolteacher, while his servant shall
         impersonate his master (i). Hortensio, another suitor, plans
         to gain access to Bianca by posing as a musician. Now
         Petruchio enters Padua in search of a rich wife, and
         Hortensio and Gremio (suitors for Bianca) arrange for him to
         meet the shrewish sister, whom he believes he can tame.

         ACT II. Petruchio calls upon his prospective father-in-law.
         He brings Hortensio with him, disguised as a musician. The
         two are accompanied by the other suitor, Gremio, who believes
         that Lucentio is presenting Gremio's case to Bianca.
         Hortensio's musical endeavors are cut short by Kate, who
         hangs his lute about his ears. Petruchio attempts to take
         Katherine by storm; and, after they battle merrily, he tells
         Baptista that they will marry on the following Sunday. The
         way is now cleared for Bianca to marry. Baptista, to settle
         things among the quarreling lovers, tells them that the one
         who offers the greatest dowry shall marry Bianca. Tranio
         (disguised as Lucentio) makes the largest offer, Bianca
         agrees to accept his offer providing Lucentio's father will
         give assurance for it. Now Tranio tries to think of someone
         to impersonate Lucentio's father (i).

         ACT III. Lucentio, disguised as as a schoolteacher,
         introduces himself to Bianca. Hortensio does likewise while
         pretending to give a music lesson. Hortensio, who supposes
         Lucentio to be a simple pendant, is worried that the teacher
         may become a serious rival (i). Meanwhile Katherine makes
         ready for the wedding. Petruchio, however fails to appear and
         Katherine weeps bitter tears of shame and rage. When the
         tardy groom finally makes his appearance, both he and his
         servant are wearing fantastic clothing. Petruchio's garb
         shocks the whole assemblage, but he insists on keeping it on
         for the wedding. He acts wildly throughout the wedding, and
         after the ceremonies he announces, that he is leaving before
         the wedding feast, a thing unthinkable. Katherine objects
         with something of her old spirit, but Petruchio forces her to
         go with him (ii).

         ACT IV. Petruchio brings Kate to his home, where he abuses
         his servants, and keeps her from eating by pretending the
         meat is burned. Then the wild bridegroom takes Kate to her
         room and keeps her awake with his abuse. These strange
         actions are part of a plan to tame her (i). As a further step
         he humiliates her by pretending to disapprove of her new
         wardrobe and by forcing her to journey back to her father's
         house in old clothes (iii). On the way they meet Vincentio,
         journeying to Padua to see his son, Lucentio (v).
             Back in Padua Hortensio sees that Bianca loves the
         disguised pendant and leaves his own disguise, scornfully
         condemning Bianca for leaving a "a gentleman" and making a
         "a god" of "such a cullion." Hortensio finally vows not to
         court her any more but instead to marry a wealthy widow. The
         wily Tranio now carries out his plan to find a pseudo-father
         to guarantee Lucentio's dowry. He tricks an old man into
         pretending that he is Vincentio, the father, by telling him
         he will be put to death if he does not comply (ii). Baptista
         accepts the false Vincentio and they agree to arrange a
         dowry. But Lucentio's servants advise their master to keep
         his disguise a little while longer. They further advise him
         to slip away with Bianca and marry her secretly while the
         others think that he is escorting her to dinner (iv).

         ACT V. Petruchio and the real Vincentio arrive at Lucentio's
         house in Padua, where Vincentio is refused admittance by the
         pseudo-Vincentio. Now Lucentio appears in his own guise,
         safely wedded to Bianca, and asks pardon of his father and
         new father-in-law. He confesses the whole trick (i).
         Everything being settled amicably, all parties gather to
         banquet at Lucentio's house. After being twitted fo
         marrying a shrew, Petruchio wagers that his wife is the most
         obedient of all the new brides. Both Lucentio and Hortensio
         send for their wives, but both refuse to come. Katherine not
         only comes at once when Petruchio sends for her, a most
         thoroughly tamed shrew, but she also upbraids the other
         brides for not obeying their husbands and recites a moral
         lecture on the proper behavior of wives (ii).

         BACKGROUND: This play appeared in two quarto editions (both
         much garbled) before the First Folio edition in 1623. There
         is a tradition dating from the eighteenth century that the
         play was written at the express command of Queen Elizabeth.
         It is usually believed, too, that "The Merry Wives" is a
         reworked version of an earlier play. The most likely source
         of the play is "The Tale of the Two Lovers of Pisa Newes out
         of Purgatory" (1590).

         ACT I. Justice Shallow and Sir Hugh Evans wish to arrange a

         He will, he says, make love to both Mrs. ford (who he has
         heard rules her husband's house) and to Mrs. Page, who also
         "bears the purse" of her family. He sends letters to the two
         women (iii). Mrs. Quickly receives Evans' letter and promises
         to help Slender all she can, though it turns out a little
         later that she has already promised another suitor, Fenton,
         the same thing. But the bearer of the letter is discovered by
         Dr. Caius, Mrs. Quickly's master, who also loves Anne Page.
         The irate doctor sends a message to Evans, the author of the
         letter, challenging him to a dual (iv).

         ACT II. Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page receive love letters from
         Falstaff and plan to hatch a plot against this "greasy
         knight"; but meanwhile Page and Ford are warned by Pistol and
         Nym that Falstaff plans to woo their wives. Ford, a very
         jealous man, arranges to be introduced to Falstaff as
         "Brook," (i) and when he meets the knight he offers to pay
         Falstaff to make love to Mrs. Ford; not trusting his wife, he
         wishes to test her. When Falstaff agrees and Ford finds he
         already has an appointed with her, the jealous husband is
         furious. He immediately plans to surprise Falstaff with his
         wife. Just before this, Mrs. Quickly has come to Falstaff
         from Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page with a message that Ford will be
         away from home between ten and eleven so that Falstaff can
         meet her at that time. Mrs. Page, she says, wants Falstaff to
         send his servant Robin as a go-between to arrange a meeting
         (ii). Dr. Caius has been waiting in a field to meet Sir Hugh
         Evans. The host of the Garter, sensing a fine sport, offers
         to lead Caius to Anne Page's house (iii).

         ACT III. The host, however, leads him to another field, where
         Sir Hugh Evans is waiting. The dual dissolves when the host
         confesses that he has purposely directed the antagonists to
         wait in different places, and the two make peace, vowing
         revenge upon the roguish host for his trick (i). Returning
         from the "dueling" field, the party meets the jealous Ford,
         who is his way to (he thinks) surprise his wife with the
         villainous Falstaff (ii). Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford have in the
         meantime, planned a warm reception for the "greasy knight."
         While Falstaff is making impassioned speeches to Mrs. Ford,
         Mrs. Page rushes in to warn the couple that Ford is
         approaching with officers. Falstaff is hidden in a basket of
         dirty laundry, and servants carry it away to dump it (as had
         been previously arranged by the two women) in a foul ditch
         along the Thames (iii). At Page's house, Fenton (whom Anne
         really loves), is rebuffed by Anne's father, who prefers
         Slender as a suitor. But Mrs. Page's apparent friendliness
         toward Fenton promises another complication (iv). Falstaff,
         drying out at the Garter Inn, receives Mrs. Quickly, who
         apologizes for his plight and arranges another rendezvous
         with Mrs. Ford. Falstaff, unsuspecting, passes this
         information to "Mr. Brook," the real Mr. Ford. Ford, now in a
         paroxysm of jealous rage, swears that he will catch the
         guilty pair this time (v).

         ACT IV. After Mrs. Page learns that Falstaff has gone to Mrs.
         Ford's (i), she again comes to warn her friend of the jealous
         husband's approach. This time the merry wives dress the
         errant knight as Mrs. Ford's maid's aunt in order to slip him
         out of the house. Ford comes again, together with his
         friends, and this time searches the laundry basket but, of
         course finds nothing. Spying the knight dressed as the fat
         old women, whom he hates, Ford beats him soundly and drives
         him away (ii). Now the wives tell their husbands of the plot,
         and the whole group decides to catch the fat knight once
         more. Falstaff will be asked to meet the merry wives in a
         wood, disguised as a wood nymph, with horns on his head. Anne
         Page as the queen of the fairies, accompanied by a group of
         children disguised as sprites, will surround Falstaff and
         pinch him black and blue. Then, when he has told the truth
         about the whole affair, he will be "mocked home to Windsor"
         (iv). So Mrs. Quickly bears Falstaff yet another letter (v).
         Now it transpires that more will happen in the wood than Mrs.
         Ford or Mrs. Page had planned. Fenton bears a tale to the
         host of the Garter. Page, he says, has instructed his
         daughter to slip away with Slender during the excitement and
         to marry him immediately. Mrs. Page has instructed Anne to
         slip away with Dr. Caius and to marry him. Both parents have
         arranged for the girl to wear distinctive dress so that the
         suitors will recognize her. But she and Fenton have arranged
         to slip her off together, fooling both parents, and the host
         arranges to furnish a minister to marry them (vi).

         ACT V. Falstaff, the insatiable, arranges with Mrs. Quickly
         for the last meeting (i). In the wood, Slender and Page
         arrange for Slender's abduction of Anne (ii), while Mrs. Page
         and Dr. Caius are also completing their plans (iii), and Sir
         Hugh Evans is giving some last minute coaching to the
         "fairies" (iv). Falstaff arrives and meets the merry wives;
         then the fairies descend upon him. While the "fairies" are
         tormenting the luckless knight, Slender and Caius each slip
         off with a boy they believe to be Anne Page. She, however,
         runs away with Fenton. The merry wives and their husbands
         approach Falstaff-a dejected rogue now-and reveal their true
         identity. Slender and Caius both return and tell how they
         were deceived. When Anne and Fenton come back, married, they
         find Page a forgiving father; and at Mrs. Page's suggestion,
         the party troops away to "laugh this sport o'er by a country
         fire" (v).

         BACKGROUND. Much Ado About Nothing was first published as a
         quarto in 1600, after being performed during the winter of
         1598-1599. Its chief source is the twenty-second tale in a
         collection of Italian "Novella" by Matteo Bandello, while the
         subplot is original with Shakespeare.

                                ACT BY ACT ANALYSIS
                                -------------------

         ACT I. Benedick and Claudio come to Messina from the wars.
         Claudio promptly falls in love with Hero, while Benedick
         takes up an old game of bickering with Beatrice. Don Pedro,
         the military superior of the young men, promises to intercede
         with Leonato, Hero's father, on behalf of Claudio-in fact to
         make Claudio's proposal to Hero for him (i). Leonato is
         informed of the young man's intentions and is well pleased
         (ii). But when Don Pedro's bastard brother, John, hears of
         Claudio's intentions he rails against the young man and plans
         to block his marriage plans if possible (iii).

         ACT II. John, helped by his man Borachio, immediately tries
         to thwart Claudio's plans. While, during a masquerade, Don
         Pedro is approaching Hero on Claudio's behalf, John comes to
         Claudio, who he pretends to think is Benedick. He tells
         Claudio that Don Pedro is really wooing Hero for himself and
         asks the pretended Benedick to dissuade Pedro from such a
         course, saying that Hero is unworthy. Pedro, though, summons
         Claudio and tells him that he has won Hero for the hopeful
         lover; and, elated by his success as a matchmaker, Pedro says
         that he will now make a match for Beatrice and Benedick (i).
         John now tries another plan to impersonate Hero, then be
         discovered in a compromising situation with him (ii).
         Meanwhile Leonato and Claudio are helping Pedro arrange a
         match between Benedick and Beatrice. They, knowing Benedick
         is listening, chat for his benefit-Beatrice, they say, loves
         him. Benedick immediately begins to suspect double meanings
         in Beatrice's barbed remarks (iii).

         ACT III. Hero and Ursula play the same game with Beatrice,
         he is completely taken in and immediately resolves to tame
         her own contemptuous spirit (i). John, intent upon his evil
         work, now tells Claudio that Hero is unfaithful, and the
         young man swears that if she is untrue he will shame her
         before the congregation on their wedding day (ii). But while
         Borachio and Conrade, his accomplice, are discussing
         Borachio's evil deed, they are overheard and captured by two
         watchmen, Dogberry and Verges (iii). The next day Hero
         prepares for the wedding ceremony, helped by her ladies in
         waiting (iv), while the watchmen tell Leonato of Borachio and
         Conrade. They wish Leonato to examine the culprits; but he,
         busy with the coming wedding, puts them off and tells them to
         examine the fellows themselves (v).

         ACT IV. Claudio, true to his promise, (thinking Hero guilty)
         denounces her and shames her before the congregation. The
         poor girl swoons, and when Claudio and Pedro leave, they
         think her dead. The friar who was to perform the ceremony
         suggests that Leonato continue to pretend that Hero is dead
         while they investigate the case. Her supposed death, too,
         will soften Claudio's heart, and turn public censure to pity.
         Benedick now admits his love for Beatrice and she for him.
         She asks him, as a favor, to kill Claudio. At first he
         refuses and, as usual, she berates him (i). Dogberry and
         Verges examine Borachio and Conrade, who confess and
         implicate John. John, they say, has already fled. The sexton
         orders the knaves bound and brought before Leonato (ii).

         ACT V. Now Claudio's friends turn against him. Leonato,
         Antonio, and Benedick all challenge Claudio to duel, accusing
         him of murdering the innocent Hero. When Dogberry and Verges
         bring in the rogues, Leonato tells Claudio that he must
         broadcast Hero's innocence to the people, then marry
         Leonato's niece whom he has never seen (i). Meanwhile,
         Beatrice is writing verses to Benedick. When he comes to her
         and tells her that he has challenged Claudio, she tells
         Benedick that she loves him (ii). Claudio places an epitaph
         on Hero's tomb, telling of her innocence and tragic death
         (iii). and comes to marry Leonato's niece as he promised.
         Hero, masked enters with her maid in waiting. Claudio,
         thinking that she is Leonato's niece, swears to marry her. At
         a tense moment, she unmasks and reveals herself as Hero.
         Beatrice now publicly accepts Benedick, not so much, she says
         jokingly, that she loves him, but to save his life, for she
         heard that he was "in a consumption." A messenger enters and
         announces the capture of the evil John (iv).



    heard that he was "in a consumption
