         BACKGROUND.  No printed edition of the play appears before
         that of the first Folio (1623).  It was performed in 1599 or
         1600.  The play is a dramatization of a pastoral tale called
         "Rosalynde, Euphuses' Golden Legacie," written by Thomas
         Lodge in 1590.  This tale, in turn, is based on an early
         English poem "The Tale of Gamelyn," which has at times
         (though not at present) been attributed to Chaucer.

                                -------------------

         ACT I.  Orlando, the younger son of Sir Rowland de Boys,
         rebels at being kept virtual prisoner by his elder brother,
         Oliver.  He plans to leave, but Oliver, who hates him and
         wishes to keep his patrimony, arranges with Charles, wrestler
         for the Duke Frederick, to kill or cripple the youth (i).
         Orlando, however, manages to throw and injure the redoubtable
         fellow, and his victory is witnessed by Rosalind, daughter of
         the  banished Duke, and her cousin Celia, daughter  of the
         present duke, Frederick.  Rosalind instantly falls in love
         with the young man and he with her (ii), but  as soon as
         Orlando has left, Duke Frederick orders Rosalind banished.
         She plans to flee to her father in the forest, accompanied by
         Celia (iii).

         ACT II.  When Duke Frederick finds his daughter gone, he
         orders Oliver brought before him if Orlando cannot be found,
         since he heard that Orlando has accompanied the girls (ii).
         Meanwhile Orlando has returned home and discovers that Oliver
         plans to murder him.  He flees to Arden Forest, together with
         old Adam, a faithful servant (iii).  Rosalind disguised as a
         youth, "Ganymede," and Celia as the youth's sister, "Aliena."
         They meet two shepherds, Corin and Silvius, and arrange to
         buy a shepherd's hut, a flock, and pasture (iv).  In another
         part of the forest the banished Duke discusses the
         philosophizing of his melancholy courtier Jaques (i), who is
         being made even more than usually morose by the singing of
         another courtier, Amiens (v).  When the Duke meets him,
         however, Jaques now merry, having met the clever fool,
         Touchstone, in the forest (vii).  Meanwhile Orlando has been
         desperately searching for food (vi); now with drawn sword he
         enters the Duke's banqueting place and demands food.  But the
         Duke meets him with unexpected kindness and welcomes him as
         Sir Rowland's son (vii).

         ACT III.  Back at the court,  Duke Frederick has told Oliver
         that if he cannot find his brother he will lose all his
         estates (i).  While this is going on, Orlando is wandering
         though the forest,  hanging love  verses to Rosalind upon the
         branches  of trees.  Rosalind finds the verses, and finally,
         still in her disguise, she talks with the despondent Orlando.
         As "Ganymede" she offers to pose as Rosalind and to allow
         Orlando to practice his wooing with her (ii).  While Touch-
         stone is planning his own romance (iii),  Rosalind laments
         that Orlando has not come to her as he had promised (iv).
         Now still disguised as "Ganymede" she witnesses the love
         affair of Phebe and Silvius, two shepherds.  Phede treats her
         swain coldly and "Ganymede" chides her for it,  but Phebe
         instantly falls in love with "Ganymede." When Rosalind
         ("Ganymede") leaves, Phebe says that she will write the youth
         a letter and that Silvius must bear it (v).

         ACT IV.  Orlando practices wooing the disguised Rosalind (i);
         Jaques talks with  hunters in the forest (ii); Silvius
         delivers Phebe's letter (iii).  Now a chastened Oliver finds
         Rosalind.  While sleeping in a forest,  he tells her, he was
         saved from the attack of a lioness by his brother Orlando.
         Orlando has been wounded and bears a bloody napkin as a token
         of the fight.  Rosalind swoons,  then pretends that  she has
         been counterfeiting (iii).

         ACT V.  Orlando and Oliver are now reconciled,  and Oliver
         tells his brother that he has fallen in love with "Aliena,"
         the disguised Celia.  They will be married, he says, the next
         day.  Orlando moons for his Rosalind, but "Ganymede" comforts
         him.  She is,  she says,  a magician; and if Oliver marries
         "Aliena," Orlando will marry Rosalind.  She also promises
         rather ambiguously to solve the love problems of the shepherd
         and shepherdess.  Phebe promises to marry Silvius if she
         decides not to marry "Ganymede" (ii).  Touchstone, meanwhile,
         is continuing his romance with Audrey  (i,iii).  At last
         Rosalind reveals her true identity.  Phebe,  who,  of course,
         cannot marry the nonexistent Ganymede,  promises to marry
         Silvius.  Jaques de Boys,  brother of Oliver and Orlando, now
         comes with the news that Duke Frederick,  who has been
         converted and forsworn the world,  has restored his brother,
         the banished Duke to his estates. Rosalind recites an
         epilogue (iv).

                                Cast of Characters
                                 Main Characters

         ORSINO,  Duke of Illyria,  a romantic young man.  At first in
             love with Olivia,  he eventually settles his affection on
             Viola.
         SEBASTIAN,  Viola's twin brother.  When Viola is dressed as a
             young man,  she and Sebastian are often mistaken for each
             other.
         SIR TOBY BELCH,  Olivia's roistering uncle.  In the Falstaff
             tradition Sir Toby is always looking for a gull; and,
             except for one instance,  when in a tight place he
             invariably lands on his feet.
         SIR ANDREW AGUECHEEK,  the perfect fool and gull.  Sir Toby
             uses him as his bank by promising to win him Olivia's
             hand.
         MALVOLIO,  Olivia's humorless steward.  Although Malvolio has
             sometimes been played as a heavy,  semitragic character,
             Shakespeare obviously intends him as a comic  butt.
         OLIVIA, a rich countess and a comparatively colorless
             character when viewed in relation to Viola.  Orsino falls
             in love with her; she,  in turn,  falls in love with the
             disguised Viola; then,  thinking that Sebastian is Viola,
             she induces him to marry her.
         VIOLA, one of Shakespeare's famous women.  Sweet and
             dependent by nature, she meets the difficulties of her
             situation with courage.  She falls in love with Orsino
             and eventually wins him.
         MARIA, Olivia's maid.  A sharp,  but essentially kindly
             woman, she confounds Malvolio with her plot.  Eventually
             she wins Sir Toby.

         FABIAN, servant to Olivia.
         FESTE, a clown, servant to Olivia.

              (PLACE: A city in Illyria, and the seacoast near it.)

         BACKGROUND.  Performed in 1600, "Twelfth Night" was not
         printed until the First Folio in 1623.  The sources are
         comparatively obscure, but the play is probably based on two
         tales in "Barnabe Riche, his Farewell to Military Profession"
         (1581).  The first of these is "Apolonius and Sillus," the
         second, "Of Two Brethren and their Wives."  "Riche's source
         was either Belleforest or Bandello.

                               -------------------

         ACT I.  Duke Orsino has been besieging the beautiful Olivia
         for her hand in marriage; she, however, refuses every plea of
         his emissaries.  Ostensibly she refuses because she in
         mourning for her brother (i).  Meanwhile, Viola and a sea
         captain, who have been rescued from a shipwreck, land on the
         coast of Illyria; and Viola believes that her twin brother
         Sebastian, has been lost in the wreck.  Viola,  defenseless,
         determines to disguise herself as a young man and to seek
         service with Orsino,  who she hears is noble and generous
         (ii).  Under the name of Cesario,  she gains Orsino's favor;
         and,  although she falls in love with Orsino herself,  she
         consents to become his go-between with Olivia (iv).  In
         Olivia's household the only retainer who seems to enjoy the
         enforced mourning for Olivia's brother is the humorless and
         egotistical Malvolio (v).  Sir Toby Belch and his gull,  Sir
         Andrew Aguecheek,  both enjoy carousing, aided and abetted by
         Maria.  Sir Toby is keeping his hand in Sir Andrew's pocket
         by promising to win Olivia for Sir Andrew (iii).  Cesario
         (Viola) arrives to carry "his" master's pleas to Olivia; but
         to complicate matters,  Olivia feels herself falling in love
         with the pseudo-page.  After Cesario leaves,  she sends her
         own ring to "him," pretending that "he" has lost it in her
         presence, so that "he" will be sure to return to her (v).

         ACT II.  When Cesario receives the ring from Olivia's
         messenger, "he" realizes and deplores the Olivia is in love
         with "him" (ii).  Sir Toby and Sir Andrews get drunk late at
         night. Maria enters and begs them to be more quiet; but when
         Malvolio comes in and reprimands them (including Maria) for
         their drunkenness,  he seals his own doom: they determine to
         be revenged on him (iii).  They forge a note which appears to
         have been sent by Olivia to a lover; when Malvolio receives
         it, he is sure that he is that lover.  The note instructs him
         to "be opposite with a kinsman, surely with servants"; to
         wear yellow hose; to go cross-gartered; and to smile
         continually in Olivia's presence (v).  Meanwhile,  two events
         have occurred:  (1) the presumably dead Sebastian turns up in
         Illyria with Antonio,  a sea captain (i); (2) Orsino requests
         Cesario to carry a further message to Olivia (iv).

         ACT III.  When Cesario arrives at Olivia's house,  Olivia
         openly tells "him" that she loves "him"; but Cesario must, of
         course,  ignore Olivia's advances (i).  Meanwhile,  the plot
         against Malvolio works to perfection: his strange antics in
         following the injunctions of the note cause him to be
         imprisoned in a dark room as insane (ii,iv). Sir Toby, making
         more mischief, foments a dual between Sir Andrew and Cesario,
         on the pretext that the page is a rival suitor for Olivia's
         hand. As the two unwilling dualists prepare to fight, Antonio
         rushes in and, believing that Cesario is Sebastian, prevents
         the dual; however, when officers seize Antonio as a former
         enemy to Illyria, he asks Cesario, whom he supposes to be
         Sebastian, for the purse which has given the young man
         earlier in the day (iii,iv). Upon Cesario's natural denial
         that "he" knows Antonio, the good captain's faith in human
         nature is shaken. However, Cesario, upon reflection, realizes
         that the name "Sebastian" has been spoken; and "he" hopes
         that "his" brother may be alive (iv).

         ACT IV. Convinced that Cesario is a coward, Sir Andrew rushes
         out to challenge the page; but instead of Cesario he finds
         Sebastian. Olivia's entrance prevents Sir Andrew from getting
         hurt.  She, also believing Sebastian to be Cesario, desires
         him to grant her an interview (i).  The clown Feste,
         pretending to be Sir Topas the Parson, baits Malvolio in his
         prison; then assuming his natural voice,  Feste offers to
         obtain some paper and ink for the prisoner (ii).  Olivia now
         convinces the not-unwilling Sebastian that he should marry
         her (iii).

         ACT V.  The Duke and Cesario arrive before Olivia's home,
         where they meet Antonio.  When Antonio again reproaches
         Cesario-whom he still believes Sebastian-the Duke is
         completely baffled by Antonio's insistence that the young man
         has just arrived in Illyria.  Olivia enters and speaks in
         loving accents to Cesario.  Orsino is naturally angry at what
         he supposes has been Cesario's treacherous attempt to win
         Olivia's affection; but when a priest swears that he has
         recently married the couple, Orsino becomes furious.  Sir
         Andrew and Sir Toby, meanwhile, have inadvertently picked a
         fight with Sebastian (believing him to be Cesario) and both
         enter wounded and bleeding. However, when Sebastian appears
         almost immediately, all the principals realize that they have
         been dealing with two persons.  Matches are made all around:
         Sir Toby has married Maria because she has invented the plot
         against Malvolio; Orsino offers to marry Viola.  Everyone is
         happy except poor Malvolio, who vows revenge on the whole
         group (i).

         BACKGROUND: This play is probably one recast by Shakespeare
         about 1601 after being originally written considerably
         earlier.  The earliest printed version is that of the First
         Folio of 1623.  The source for the main plot is William
         Painters "Palace of Pleasure" (1566), which is in turn based
         on a novel from Boccaccio's "Decameron."

                                 -------------------

         ACT I. Bertram, the young Count of Rousillon, departs for the
         King's court, leaving behind his mother and Helena, his
         mother's ward.  Helena is the daughter of a famous physician,
         now dead, and has been left in the Countess' care.  Though
         she feels that she is hopelessly beneath him, Helena loves
         Bertram (i).  While Bertram is being received cordially by
         the King (ii), Helena confesses her love to the countess.
         She also unfolds a plan.  The King is suffering from an ulcer
         which has been pronounced incurable by all doctors in the
         country, but Helena possesses a wonderful medicine to treat
         the condition.  She now proposes to go to the King, and at
         the same time be near Bertram (iii).

         ACT II. When Helena arrives and proposes to cure the King, he
         at first objects; but he finally accepts her treatment on the
         condition that she will forfeit her life if it fails.  As a
         reward, if the cure is successful, she may ask the favor of
         choosing any husband she wishes (i).  The King is cured, and
         when he summons his lords to grant Helena her request, she,
         of course chooses Bertram.  But Bertram will have none of
         her.  Though the King forces him to marry her, he immediately
         plans to run away to fight in the Tuscan wars.  Parolles, his
         rascally follower, agrees with false heartiness to all his
         master says (iii) and is deputized to tell Helena that she
         will be sent to Rousillon, but that her husband will have
         none of her (iv).  Bertram takes his leave from Helena very
         coldly and departs for Flourence, the rogue Parolles
         accompanying him (v).

         ACT III.  The Duke of Flourence, who is hard pressed for
         fighting men (i), welcomes Bertram and makes him general of
         his horse troops (iii).  Meanwhile the scorned Helena returns
         sadly to Rousillon.  She shows the Countess a letter from
         Bertram setting forth the impossible conditions under which
         the young lord will be reconciled to her as a wife.  He will
         never accept her until she has possession of a ring which he
         has never removed from his finger and until she has conceived
         a child by him- conditions seem utterly impossible of
         forfillment (ii).  Helena, though, has a plan.  She slips
         away from Rousillon, leaving a letter for the Countess (iv),
         and journeys to Flourence as a pilgrim.  Outside the city
         walls she meets the Widow Capilet and her daughter Diana,
         from whom she learns that Bertram has been busily attempting
         to seduce the daughter (v).  Helena concocts a scheme with
         the widow.  Diana shall lead Bertram on until she secures the
         ring from his finger.  Then she shall make an appointment
         with the faithless husband in her chamber; but at the
         allotted time, Helena shall substitute herself for Diana in
         the darkness (vii).  Meanwhile a lighter touch has been added
         by the actions of Parolles.  He has made himself unpopular
         with the Flourentine soldiers, who wish to expose him as a
         coward and rogue.  They propose to Bertram that they will
         test him by pretending to be enemies and capturing the fellow
         (vi).

         ACT IV. That night Parolles goes out into the darkness on a
         mission of pretending danger, planning to stroll about for a
         time, then to return with a story of wild encounters and
         deeds of bravery.  When the conspiring Flourentines seize
         him, his bubble of bravery instantly collapses (i), and
         Bertram is allowed to witness his rascally follower's
         cowardice (iii).  But before this occurs, Bertram visits
         Diana, who secures the ring from him and makes an appointment
         with him for midnight.  During the night, she says, while
         they are in bed together, she will give him a ring in return
         (ii).  After he has kept the appointment Bertram makes plans
         to return to France.  The war is now over, and he feels that
         the letters of high recommendation that he bears from the
         Duke of Flourence will soften the King's anger against him.
         Helena, he is told, is dead (iii), but she is actually
         arranging to follow her husband to Marseilles where she plans
         to confront him (iv).  Back in Rousillon, Lafeu tells the
         Countess that Helena is dead.  The King, he says, has
         forgiven Bertram and now plans a marriage between the young
         man and Lafeu's daughter (v).

         ACT V. Helena, accompanied by Diana and the widow, not
         finding Bertram in Marseilles, prepares to follow him to
         Rousillon, whence they learn he has gone.  Diana sends a
         letter to proceed them (i).  The King, his coming announced
         by Lafeu (ii), arrives at Rousillon and begins to plan the
         new marriage for Bertram, whom he has forgiven. Lafeu asks
         for a pledge supplied him by the supposed Diana during their
         night of love.  All are shocked when the ring is recognized
         as Helena's, given her by the King himself.  None of them
         believes Bertram's flimsy story of how he came by it-he says
         the ring was thrown to him from a casement window by a noble
         lady and the King has Bertram arrested.  He is again
         thoroughly enraged with the young man, even to the point of
         suspecting him of murdering Helena.  Now Diana's letter
         arrives from Marseilles.  In it Diana claims that Bertram has
         promised to marry her if his wife died; now that this has
         happened, she demands he make good his promise. Diana follows
         close upon the heels of the letter and confronts Bertram.
         Now the youth is forced to confess giving his ring to Diana
         and accepting a ring in return, but he accuses the girl of
         being a common camp follower.  The King demands that Diana
         tell where she got Helena's ring-a demand enforced by the
         threat of death if she refuses to tell. Diana answers that
         her mother will give her bail, and the widow enters with
         Helena.  She has fulfilled Bertram's impossible demands, and
         the now thoroughly chastened youth begs her forgiveness.  The
         King brings the action to a close, reciting an epilogue that
         "All is well ended" (iii).

         BACKGROUND.  "Pericles" was first published in a very corrupt
         quarto edition in 1609 but was not included in either the
         First Folio edition of 1623 or the second of 1632.  The work
         was probably first composed and presented in 1607 or 1608.
         Most scholars agree that "Pericles" is only partly the work
         of Shakespeare and most agree in assigning him the last three
         acts.  The play is a dramatization of the story "Apolonius of
         Tyre," a very well-known littery theme.

                              ACT BY ACT ANALYSIS
                              -------------------

         ACT I.  Each of the acts and some of the scenes are
         introduced by an actor representing Gower, the English poet,
         who presents an epilogue together with (in some cases) a
         dumb show.  Antiochus, king of Antioch, has given prospective
         suitors for the hand of his daughter a riddle to solve. Those
         who fail to solve the riddle must die.  Pericles comes to
         solve the riddle and from it he discovers that Antiochus is
         engaged in an incestuous relationship with his daughter.
         Knowing that Antiochus will not willingly let him live after
         he has guessed this, Pericles flees back to Tyre.  He guessed
         rightly; for Antiochus immediately appoints Thaliard, an
         Antiochan lord, to murder Pericles.  Finding that his quarry
         has flown, Antiochus sends Thaliard after the departed prince
         (i).  Arrived safely in Tyre, Pericles fears some such plot
         as Antiochus has planned. Helicanus-one of Pericles' lords
         whom he takes in confidence-fears the same thing and suggests
         that Pericles go traveling until Antiochus has lost his rage
         or is reported dead.  Leaving his government in the hands of
         Helicanus (ii), Pericles departs ahead of Thaliard, who plans
         to tell Antiochus that Pericles has died at sea (iii).
         Pericles lands at poverty-stricken Tarus, bringing provisions
         to relieve the distressed inhabitants, an act which Cleon,
         the governor, is highly grateful (iv).

         ACT II.  Here Pericles tarries for a time, and a grateful
         people erect a statue in his honor. But when a messenger
         brings news of Thaliards visit to Tyre, Pericles believes
         it dangerous to stay longer in Tarus, and journeys on to
         Pentapolis where he loses his fleet in a shipwreck and barely
         manages to stagger ashore alive.  He learns that the king of
         Pentapolis, Simonides, is planning a tourney for the hand of
         his daughter; and after rescuing his armor from the nets of
         the fishermen whom he meets upon the shore, Pericles plans to
         enter the tourney (i).  After passing in review before the
         king and his daughter (ii), Pericles wins the tourney and
         attends a banquet, at which it becomes evident that Thasia,
         the daughter, thinks highly of him (iii).  After pretending
         anger that such a penniless fellow should presume to court
         his daughter (an act which Pericles, fearing reprisals from
         the king, denies) Simonides the joins hands of the young
         couple in marriage (v).  Meanwhile, back in Tyre, news has
         reached the court that Antiochus and his daughter have both
         died.  The Tyrean lords, not knowing whether Pericles is
         alive or dead, wish to appoint Helicanus king. But Helicanus
         insists that they search for their missing lord for another
         year before they take such a step.  (iv).

         ACT III.  Gowar tells us in the prologue that Pericles has
         married the beautiful Thasia and that she is with a child.
         When receives a message telling him of the state affairs of
         Tyre and the necessity of his immediate return, he leaves for
         home, accompanied by his wife.  In a storm at sea Thasia
         gives birth to a daughter but dies during her delivery, and
         is buried at sea in a well-caulked coffin.  Since they are
         near Tarus, Pericles runs for this port, since he thinks his
         newborn daughter cannot survive the long journey back to Tyre
         (i).  But in Ephesus there lives one Cerimon, uncanny skilled
         in medicine, and when the dead queens coffin floats ashore
         here, Cerimon revives her (ii).  Since Thaisa despairs of
         ever seeing Pericles again, she leaves the world and enters
         the temple of Diana as a priestess (iv).  Pericles, who has
         in the meantime reached Tarus safely, leaves his daughter,
         whom he names Marina for her sea birth, with his friend
         Cleon, while he sails back to reclaim his throne (iii).

         ACT IV.  Left in the care of Cleon and his wife, Marina grows
         into such a beautiful girl, so skilled in all the arts, that
         she quite eclipses Philoten, Cleon's daughter.  Dionyza,
         Philoten's mother, in a fury of jealousy, plans to murder
         Marina and commissions a servant, Leonine, to do the deed.
         But before the fellow can commit the act, Marina is seized by
         pirates who carry her away (i) to Mytilene, where they sell
         her to a brothel keeper, who immediately has his servant sent
         to cry this new virgin ware upon the streets (ii).  Back in
         Tarus, Dionyza confesses her evil deed to her husband, who,
         though does condone the act, makes no attempt to punish his
         wife (iii).  They build a monument to the girl which Gower
         and a dumb show reveal as having been visited by the grief-
         stricken father, who puts on a sackcloth and makes hermit's
         vows as he returns to his ship.  Far from dead, Marina is
         actually preaching divinity in the brothel (v).  The
         governor, who comes disguised to the brothel, is struck by
         the beauty and innocence of the girl and gives her gold
         without making any advances.  Even Boult, the pander's
         villainous servant, who is given permission by his master to
         ravish the stubborn girl, is moved by her pleas (and the gold
         she gives him).  She persuades him to remove her from the
         brothel and install her as a teacher of the fine arts in a
         decent household (vi).

         ACT V.  Gowar tells us that Marina succeeds in her purpose
         and is installed as a teacher-an occupation by which she is
         earning a good deal of money for her master, the pander.
         Pericles, who is in his grief refuses to speak to anyone, now
         visits Mytilene, and Lysimachus puts off in his barge to the
         Prince's ship.  Upon being told of Pericles affliction,
         Lysimachus who is so skilled in gentle ways, be brought in an
         attempt to cheer Pericles.  She comes, tells Pericles her
         story; and he recognizes his daughter.  The joyous father,
         hearing the music of the spheres, falls asleep and sees a
         vision of the godess Diana, who tells him to visit her temple
         at Ephesus (i).  After granting Lysimachus the hand of Marina
         upon the return from Ephesus, Pericles goes to the temple
         (ii). Here he tells his story to the assembled votaresses,
         and Thasia faints when she hears it.  A joyous reunion is
         effected, and Gowar brings an epilogue telling us that we
         have witnessed the triumph of virtue and the defeat of vice.
         Antiochus and his daughter, he says, have been struck down
         and Cleon and his daughter killed by their own people when
         their deed became public (iii).
