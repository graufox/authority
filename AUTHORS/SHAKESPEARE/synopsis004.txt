         BACKGROUND.  Composed and performed in 1604, the play was not
         printed until 1623.  A play by George Whetstone, "Promos and
         Cassandra" (1578), furnishes the direct source. Whetstone's
         play is in turn based upon an incident from the
         "Hecatommithi" (1565), a work by an Italian writer, Giraldi
         Cinthio. Cinthio is thought to have drawn his tale from an
         actual occurrence in an Italian town.  Though the play is
         usually classed among the comedies, it has been called a
         "problem play." Its dark and brooding tragic overtones are
          relieved only by a happy ending.

                                 -------------------

         ACT I.  Unwilling to enforce the harsh laws of his domain,
         the Duke of Vienna announces his plans to leave the city for
         a time.  In his absence, he appoints Angelo to rule, aided by
         Escalus (i).  The Duke, however, merely goes into hiding
         disguised as a friar, making Friar Thomas his confident
         (iii).  As soon as he assumes power, Angelo arrests Claudio
         for sexual promiscuity with Juliet, the girl Claudio plans to
         marry.  Unable to find the Duke and appeal directly for
         mercy, the unfortunate young man sends Lucio to find
         Isabella, Claudio's sister.  She is about to enter a nunnery,
         but Claudio hopes that she will delay her entrance long
         enough to intercede for him (ii).  When Isabella receives the
         message, she promises to plead with Angelo (iv).  Meanwhile,
         throughout the act the effect of Angelo's law enforcement
         campaign upon the lower strata of the city's poor society is
         illustrated by the actions of Elbow, the foolish constable,
         who pursues Madame Overdone and her servant, the clown
         Pompey.

         ACT II. Escalus appeals to Angelo on behalf of Claudio.  The
         stern deputy refuses to be lenient and justifies his
         harshness on the grounds that an example must be made (i).
         Now Isabella appears and adds her pleas to those of Escalus.
         Still unmoved, Angelo does, however, consent to see her again
         on the following day.  Left alone, Angelo wonders aloud if
         his motives concerning Isabella are honorable (ii).  Next day
         Isabella returns.  His passion thoroughly aroused, Angelo
         offers to free her brother if she will submit to him.
         Refusing, she threatens to expose him; he scoffs; no one, he
         says, will believe her story.  Utterly crushed, she realizes
         that he has spoken truly (iv).

         ACT III.  Awaiting his execution, Claudio receives Isabella,
         who tells him of Angelo's proposal.  Panicky at the thought
         of approaching death, Claudio pleads with his sister to
         accept Angelo's offer; but soon he realizes the enormity of
         the conduct.  In his role as a sympathetic friar, the Duke
         suggests a counterplot.  He suggests that the sister accept
         Angelo's monstrous proposition.  But Mariana, a girl who was
         once engaged to marry Angelo, and who still loves him, will
         be substituted when the assignation takes place (i).  On the
         comic level, Elbow continues his pursuit of Madame Overdone
         and her entourage, and finally succeeds in having them
         imprisoned.  Lucio entertains the disguised Duke with tales
         of the Duke's supposed misdemeanors, supposing that he is
         impressing a simple friar (ii).

         ACT IV.  Mariana agrees (offstage) to take Isabella's place
         "i' th' dark," and the meeting with Angelo is arranged (i).
         Angelo suspects nothing when he meets her; but instead of
         freeing Claudio, he treacherously sends his jailer a letter
         confirming the execution and demands that Claudio's head be
         sent to him.  At first the disguised Duke and jailer plan to
         substitute the head of Barnardine, a condemned criminal (ii);
         but finally they decide to spare him and send the head of an
         already dead pirate.  Now the Duke is readily to spring his
         trap for Angelo.  He writes a not telling his deputy that he
         plans to return, and arranges to be met at the city gates
         (iii).  He plots with Isabella: she is to accuse Angelo of
         deflowering her.  Mariana, the real victim, is to play
         another role (iv).

         ACT V.  Isabella denounces Angelo, who denies his guilt.  The
         Duke, now stripped of his disguise, pretends to defend the
         guilty deputy, and sends for his other self (the friar) to
         plead the women's cause.  He leaves the stage and returns
         again disguised.  At a properly dramatic moment, the poor
         friar is revealed as the real ruler of the city.  When
         Angelo, confronted by his master, confesses, he is forced to
         marry Mariana.  Once married, he is to death but is finally
         spared when it is revealed that Claudio still lives.  Claudio
         and Juliet are reunited, and the Duke announces his love for
         Isabella.  Tripped up by his earlier bragging and lying,
         Lucio is forced to marry a prostitute (i).

                                Cast of Characters
                                  Main Characters

         CYMBELINE, King of Britain, a weak man, easily swayed by his
             evil queen.
         CLOTEN, the Queen's son by a former husband.  Though he is a
             doltish lout, he is not without some patriotism.  His
             mother is intent on his marrying Imogen.
         Posthumus Leonatus, a gentleman, Imogen's husband.  In our
             day Posthumus' wager with Iachimo seems in poor taste;
             however, to the Renaissance mind it probably was a
             perfectly honest act of faith in Imogen.
         IACHIMO, the villain.  Note the similarity between his name
             and Iago's "Othello".  In general, he is the same kind of
             scheming opportunist; but his plans fail, and he is saved
             from death.
         QUEEN, Cymbeline's wife.  She is an example of the
             traditional stepmother.  Anxious to advance Cloten, she
             is completely unscrupulous in her methods.
         IMOGEN, Cymbeline's daughter by a former marriage.  She is
             one of Shakespeare's triumphs of characterization: though
             faithful and loving, she is capable of desperate measures
             when they become necessary.

         ARVIRGUS, son of Cymbeline, disguised under the name of
             Cadwal.
         BELARIUS, a banished lord disguised under the name of Morgan.
         CAIUS LUCIUS, emissary for Augustus Caesar and general of the
             Roman forces which invade Britain.
         CORNELIUS, a physician.
         GUIDERIUS, son of Cymbeline, disguised under the name of
             Polydore.
         PHILARIO, a friend of Posthumas, who introduces Posthumas to
             Iachimo.
         PISANIO, servant to Posthumus.

         BACKGROUND.  "Cymbeline" was probably composed and played in
         1610.  The first appearance in print is in the First Folio of
         1623. Some critics claim to see the hand of an interpolator
         or collaborator especially with regard to the verse of
         Posthumus vision.  The two principal sources are a tale from
         the second day of the "Decameron" by Boccaccio and
         Holinshed's "Chronicle." Shakespeare may also have received
         some ideas from the play printed in 1589, "The Rare Triumphs
         of Love and Fortune."

                              -------------------

         ACT I.  Cymbeline, King of Britain, has married a second
         wife, a widow with one son, Cloten.  The Queen, to protect
         the interests of her son, wishes him to marry Imogen,
         daughter of Cymbeline and heiress to the throne.  However her
         plans hit a snag when Imogen marries Posthumus, a noble
         gentleman, who because of his family's bravery in the service
         of Cymbeline, has been reared at the court.  Posthumus has
         been a great favorite of the King, partly because Cymbeline's
         own sons, Guiderius and Arviragus, have been kidnapped in
         infancy.  The Queen succeeds in arousing the King's anger at
         Posthumus and Imogen because of their hasty marriage and
         convinces him that he should banish the young bridegroom from
         court, though she pretends to be friendly to the lovers.  As
         Imogen and Posthumus part, she gives him a ring and receives
         a bracelet in return (i).  When Posthumus prepares to leave
         the court for exile in Italy, the doltish Cloten draws his
         sword on him; but they are parted before Cloten is hurt
         (i,ii). The only person left at court to comfort the
         distracted Imogen is Pisanio, Posthumus' faithful servant
         (iii).  When Posthumus arrives in Rome and sings the praises
         of his wife in the company of Iachimo, the latter challenges
         Imogen's chastity.  A wager is then proposed: Iachimo is to
         go to Britain and test Imogen's faithfulness; if he brings
         back proof of his intimacy with her, he will receive
         Posthumus' ring and friendship; if not, he must pay Posthumus
         ten thousand ducats and fight a duel with him (iv).  Iachimo
         arrives at the British court and attempts to seduce Imogen
         with a story of Posthumus' unfaithfulness to her; but when
         she refuses to believe the lie, Iachimo dissembles, says that
         he is has been testing her, and asks her to keep a trunk full
         of treasure for him in her room.  She willingly consents
         (vi).  Meanwhile, the Queen has a plan to rid herself of
         Imogen by putting what she thinks is a deadly poison in the
         hand of Pisanio with instructions to deliver it as a cordial
         to Imogen; however, Cornelius, the physician, has mixed,
         instead of a poison, a harmless sleeping potion (v).

         ACT II.  As Imogen retires, Iachimo, who has hidden in the
         trunk, approaches her, observes the chamber closely, slips
         the bracelet off her arm, notices a mole on her left breast,
         and returns to the trunk (ii).  When he returns to Rome, he
         describes these details and shows the bracelet to Posthumus.
         The husband believes his wife guilty (iv) and delivers a
         diatribe on the weakness of the women (v). Meanwhile, Cloten
         is angered by Imogen's contemptuous treatment of his suit for
         her hand and swears revenge (iii).

         ACT III.  Pisanio receives a letter from Posthumus,
         requesting him to kill Imogen. Imogen also receives a letter
         from Posthumus, which requests her to accompany Pisanio to
         Wales ostensibly to meet him there, actually to afford
         Pisanio an opportunity to kill her (ii).  When the two arrive
         in Wales, Pisanio, unable to fulfill his masters request,
         shows her the letter.  He suggests that she dress as a boy;
         and, since Lucius, the Roman ambassador is to arrive in Wales
         shortly, he advises her to accompany the Romans to Italy, to
         find Posthumus, and to make her peace with him (iv).  Imogen,
         lost, wanders around Welsh hills and seeks refuge in a cave.
         This cave is inhabited by three mountaineers (identified in
         iii as Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus).  Belarius, a
         nobleman having been misjudged by Cymbeline, out of revenge
         has kidnapped the Kings' sons in infancy and has raised them
         under assumed names as his own sons.  When the three return
         to the cave, the boys feel unaccountably attracted to the
         disguised Imogen (vi).  Meanwhile, Lucius, who has come to
         Britain to collect tribute for Augustus Caesar, is refused
         the tribute by Cymbeline, who has egged on by the Queen and
         Cloten (i).  The Romans consequently plan to invade Britain
         (vii).  Pisanio, now that Imogen is safe, saves his own life
         by showing to Cloten Imogen's letter from Posthumus and by
         giving Cloten some of Posthumus' clothes.  Cloten now intends
         to ambush Posthumus when he comes to Wales and to ravish
         Imogen (v).

         ACT IV.  In Wales, Belarius sees Cloten and recognizes him.
         Under provocation Guiderius kills Cloten and cuts off his
         head.  Meanwhile Imogen has taken the cordial and lies
         seemingly dead in the cave.  Guiderius and Arviragus place
         her body with honors beside Cloten's headless trunk.  She
         awakens, sees the corpse dressed in Posthumus' garments, and
         believes it to be her husband.  Sick at heart, she meets
         Lucius and the Romans, tells them that the dead man is her
         master, watches him buried, and goes with Lucius as his page
         (ii).  Meanwhile, things are going badly with Cymbeline: his
         Queen is mortally ill; Cloten and Imogen are missing; and the
         Romans are on their way to Britain (iii).  In spite of the
         misgivings of Belarius, he yields to the pleas of Guiderius
         and Arviragus, and he and the boys decide to fight for
         Britain against the Romans (iv).

         ACT V.  Posthumus has received a bloody handkerchief from
         Pisanio; and, believing it to be a token of Imogen's death,
         he is struck with remorse.  He had come to Britain with the
         Romans, but now intends to disguise as a British peasant and
         to fight for Britain (i).  Posthumus, Belarius, and Arviragus
         are the heroes of the battle: they rally the Britons, who
         have been in retreat.  In single combat with Iachimo,
         Posthumus disarms him, but leaves him alive (ii).  The day
         won,  Posthumus longs for death, he displays himself as a
         Roman before the Britons and is taken prisoner (iii).  In
         prison under sentence of death, Posthumus sees a vision, in
         which Jupiter prophesies that when a lion's whelp shall be
         embraced by a piece of tender air when from a stately cedar
         lopped branches shall to the old stock and revive, then shall
         Posthumus be happy and Britain fortunate.  A messenger enters
         and orders Posthumus to be unshackled and to be taken to the
         King (iv). Meanwhile, the Queen has died, and Cornelius
         enters with her confessions of villainies: she has intended
         to murder Cymbeline himself.  Imogen, still disguised as a
         boy, is brought in with the Roman prisoners, and Lucius begs
         for her life.  Cymbeline feels that he has seen the pseudo-
         boy before, and three mountaineers are struck with wonder at
         seeing the one who they have thought was dead.  When
         Cymbeline offers to grant her a boon, she asks Iachimo, also
         among the prisoners, whence he received the ring he is
         wearing. Iachimo confesses his guilt, and in turn Cornelius
         tells his story of the supposed poison which he furnished the
         Queen.  Imogen is thereupon returned to her father and her
         husband.  When Guiderius confesses his murder of Cloten, the
         three mountaineers stand under penalty of death until
         Belarius confesses his kidnapping; then the sons are restored
         to their father.  The soothsayer now interprets Posthumus'
         vision: Posthumus Leonatus (leo-natus) is the lion's whelp;
         the tender air (mulier supposedly from mollis aer) is Imogen;
         the lofty cedar is Cymbeline, and the lost branches are his
         sons.  Everyone, even Iachimo, is forgiven; Cymbeline is to
         resume his tribute to Rome; and Rome and Britain are to live
         in peace (v).

         LEONTES, King of Sicilia.  His unwarranted jealousy of
             Hermione precipitates the action of the play.
         CAMILLO, Lord of Sicilia.  He leaves Leontes' service for
             that of Polixenes when Leontes orders him to kill
             Polixenes.  He remains faithful friend of all the
             principal characters.
         POLIXENES, King of Bohemia. Leontes suspects that Polixenes
             has cuckolded him.  Then Polixenes' opposition to his
             son's marriage to Perdita brings the action back to
             Sicilia.
         FLORIZEL, son of Polixenes and Prince of Bohemia, in love
             with Perdita.
         HERMIONE, Leontes' Queen, unjustly suspected of infidelity.
             In a simple yet effective courtroom speech, she stoutly
             maintains her innocence.
         PERDITA, daughter of Leontes and Hermione, in love with
         FLORIZEL.  The discovery of her identity fulfills the
             prophecy of the Delphic oracle.
         PAULINA, wife of Antigonus, sharp-tongued but burning for

         print in the First Folio of 1623.  The principal source is
         Robert Greene's "Pandosto, The Triumph of Time" (1588).
         There are also some minor sources.

                               ACT BY ACT ANALYSIS
                               -------------------

         ACT I. Polixenes, King of Bohemia, has been visiting at the
         court of his boyhood friend Leontes, King of Sicilia (i).
         When the time arrives for Polixenes to return to Bohemia,
         Leontes in vain begs his friend to extend his stay.  But
         Queen Hermione, at her husband's behest, finally convinces
         Polixenes that he should remain a time longer.  Now however,
         Leontes becomes irrationally jealous of Queen Hermione and
         Polixenes.  Positive in his own mind that Polixenes is
         cuckolding him and is the father of Hermione's unborn child,
         Leontes orders Camillo, Polixenes' cupbearer at the court
         Sicilian Court to poison Polixenes.  Camillo pretends to
         agree to do the deed, but immediately finds Polixenes and
         tells him of Leontes' enmity.  Polixenes takes Camillo into
         his own service and leaves the Sicilian Court by stealth.
         Meanwhile, of course, Hermione is left to bear the brunt of
         her husband's jealousy (ii).

         ACT II.  When he hears of Polixenes' departure, Leontes is
         furious.  In spite of the protests of some of his courtiers,
         Leontes separates Hermione from Mamillius, their son, and
         orders her to prison.  He proposes to hold her in confinement
         until he hears from the Delphic oracle the truth about his
         domestic situation (i).  Meanwhile, in prison Hermione gives
         birth to a daughter.  Paulina determines the child to be
         Leontes, hoping thus to soften the father's heart (ii).  But
         when she delivers the baby to Leontes, he insists that it is
         not his child and orders it burned.  Somewhat softened by the
         horrified exclamations of the courtiers, he relents to the
         extent that he pledges Antigonus, Paulina's husband, to take
         the child abroad by sea and to leave it in some remote and
         deserted place (iii).

         ACT III.  At the trial of Hermione, Leontes accuses her of
         adultery.  Simple and noble, she denies the indictment. The
         oracle from Delphi is then read in the court: it states that
         "Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true
         subject; Leontes a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly
         begotten; and the King shall live without an heir, if that
         which is lost is not found." When Leontes blasphemously
         denies the validly of the oracle, he is immediately informed
         that Mamillius has died.  To add further catastrophe, Paulina
         enters with word that Hermione is also dead.  Leontes is thus
         left completely alone (ii).  Meanwhile, in a dream Antigonus
         has been instructed to leave the babe in Bohemia and to name
         her Perdita.  He also dreams that because of his share in
         Leonte's guilt, he shall never see Paulina again.  No sooner
         has he laid Perdita on the ground than he is chased and
         killed by a bear, and the ship in which he has come is
         destroyed by a storm.  Perdita is found by a shepherd and his
         son, a clown.  The shepherds, impressed by the clothes on the
         infant and by the gold left beside her, decides to take her
         home with him (iii).

         ACT IV.  Sixteen years have elapsed; Perdita has been taught
         to consider the shepherd as her father (i).  Polixenes,
         meanwhile has received information that his son, Florizel,
         has been visiting a shepherd's hovel to see the shepherd's
         pretty daughter.  He confers with Camillo, and the two decide
         to disguise themselves and visit the shepherd so that they
         may observe Florizel's actions (ii).  Since Perdita knows
         that Florizel is the King's son, she is also worried what
         will happen if the King discovers that they are in love.
         Polixenes and Camillo arrive at the shepherd's hut during the
         sheep-shearing feast.  There is much merriment: a dance of
         shepherds and shepherdesses; a dance of satyrs; singing by
         Autolycus, a rogue who consistently cheats the clown and the
         other rustics.  When the shepherd announces the engagement of
         Perdita to Florizel, Polixenes reveals his identity;
         denounces his son with much bitterness; and threatens the
         shepherd, the clown, and Perdita with death.  Since Florizel
         has a boat ready to sail, Camillo (who now wishes to return
         to Sicilia) suggests that Florizel and Perdita sail for
         Sicilia and put themselves under Leontes' protection without
         telling him that they are fleeing from Polixenes. Camillo
         then intends to inform Polixenes of the flight and thus
         expects to secure his own return to Sicilia by following the
         lovers.  Meanwhile, to protect himself, the shepherd decides
         to reveal to Polixenes that Perdita is not his daughter and
         show the King the clothes and money he found lying beside the
         deserted child.  However, on their way to find Polixenes, the
         shepherd and the clown meet Autolycus, who, hoping to return
         to the service of the Prince, induces them to go with him on
         board Florizel's boat (iv).

         ACT V.  In Sicilia, Paulina exacts a promise from Leontes
         that he will never marry again until she can choose a wife
         for him.  Florizel and Perdita, pretending to be married,
         arrive and receive a gracious welcome from Leontes.  Word now
         comes that Polixenes is also in Sicilia, has met the shepherd
         and the clown, and intends to find the lovers.  Florizel
         confesses to Leontes that he is not married and that his
         beloved is of humble birth.  Leontes promises to intercede
         with Polixenes for the lovers (i).  By report we learn the
         following news: through the shepherd's story Perdita has been
         acknowledged the daughter of Leontes; Paulina has discovered
         Antigonus' death; and Paulina has created a statue of
         Hermione. The shepherd and the clown are now made gentlemen
         for their the part in the affair (ii).  Paulina escorts
         Leontes and the others to the others to the unveiling of the
         statue.  After Leontes has stared at the statue for several
         minutes, it comes alive; and Hermione herself descends to her
         husbands arms.  She has been hiding until her daughter is
         found.  All the families are now reunited; and, since Paulina
         has lost her husband, Leontes suggests that Camillo marry her
         (iii).

                (PLACE: A ship at sea; an uninhabited island)

         BACKGROUND. Played in 1611, this play is probably the last
         one written entirely by Shakespeare.  The first printing is
         the First Folio of 1623.  There are a number of influences
         traceable in the play, but the primary source is probably a
         letter written by William Strachey called "A true repertory
         of the wracke of the 'sea adventure,' and the redemption of
         Sir Thomas Gates, Knight," not printed until 1625 but in
         private circulation after its date of composition, July 15,
         1610.  Two other accounts of the wreck probably influenced
         Shakespeare: Sylvester Jourdan's "A Discovery of the
         Bermudas, otherwise called the Isle of Divals" and Stachey's
         "A True Declaration of the Colonie in Virginia."

         ACT I.  Because the chief interests of Prospero, Duke of
         Milan, lay in "secret studies" rather than statecraft, twelve
         years ago he was dispossessed of his dukedom by his brother
         Antonio, aided by Alonso, King of Naples.  Antonio, to gain
         Alonso's aid, promised tribute and homage to Naples.  When
         Antonio set Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, afloat in a
         rotten boat, they were saved by the ministrations of Gonzelo,
         who had put into the boat fresh water, food, clothing, and
         Prospero's books.  The two have landed on an island inhabited
         only by Caliban, son of the witch Sycorax.  By setting Ariel
         free from a tree where he had been confined by Sycorax,
         Prospero has gained an instrument by which to implement his
         deep knowledge of magic.  Prospero, meanwhile, has promised
         Ariel eventual freedom.  Although Prospero has taught Caliban
         to speak and has made much of him, Caliban has attempted to
         ravish Miranda.  As punishment, Prospero has reduced him to
         menial tasks and has kept him under enchantment (ii).  As the
         play opens, a terrible storm founders a ship carrying Alonso,
         Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, and Gonzalo form the wedding
         of Alonso's daughter (i).  This tempest has been raised by
         Prospero, who intends to gain revenge against his former
         persecutors.  Ariel separates the noble personages from the
         mariners as they seek refuge on the island; and, careful to
         save the lives of all of them, he leads Ferdinand, son of
         Alonso, to Prospero's cell.  Although Miranda and Ferdinand
         are immediately attracted to each other, Prospero charms
         Ferdinand and sets him at menial tasks; Prospero wishes to be
         certain that the conquest of his daughter be not easy (ii).

         ACT II.  On another part of the island Alonso, Sebastian,
         Antonio, Gonzalo, and others are glad to escape with their
         lives; but Alonso mourns for Ferdinand, whom he believes
         dead, and the others worry as to how they will be rescued.
         When Ariel charms all but Antonio and Sebastian to sleep,
         these two plot the murder of Alonso, intending to supplant
         him with Sebastian.  Ariel awakens the others in time to
         prevent mischief (i).  In still another part of the island
         Caliban meets the drunken Trinculo and Stephano; impressed
         especially by Stephano and his liquor, Caliban claims him as
         his master (ii).

         ACT III.  Prospero, much pleased, overhears Ferdinand's
         proposal of marriage to Miranda (i).  Meanwhile, Caliban
         proposes to Stephano that while Prospero sleeps, the two,
         together with Trinculo, surprise Prospero and kill him; they
         will then be masters of the island.  Ariel overhears their
         plans (ii).  Ariel, disguised as a harpy, then teases Alonso
         and the others: he sets a table with food, and when they try
         to eat, snatches the food away, accusing them of their
         previous sins.  Alonso is overcome with remorse (iii).

         ACT IV.  Prospero now makes his peace with Ferdinand and
         blesses the betrothal of Ferdinand and Miranda by presenting
         a pageant in which spirits clothed as Iris, Ceres, Juno, and
         nymphs celebrate the impending nuptials.  Suddenly
         remembering Caliban's plot, Prospero calls Ariel to him.
         Ariel informs him that he has charmed the conspirators, who,
         half drunk, have wandered over the island, and have landed in
         a dirty wallow.  When Caliban finally leads them to
         Prospero's cell, the drunkards discover cheap glittering
         apparel and, to Caliban's disgust, forget all about the plot.
         Ariel and the other spirits enter and drive the three roaring
         around the island (i).

         ACT V.  Ariel now leads Alonso, Gonzalo, Sebastian, and
         Antonio to Prospero's cell where Prospero discloses his
         identity, reveals Sebastian's and Antonio's abortive plot
         against Alonso, and demands the restoration of his dukedom.
         Prospero then shows the company Ferdinand and Miranda playing
         chess.  Alonso, repentant yet overjoyed to find his son
         alive, blesses the betrothal.  Ariel delivers the master and
         boatswain, who reveal that the was not sunk and is now ready
         to sail.  Finally, Ariel drives in Caliban, Stephano, and
         Trinculo with their gaudy apparel; when the whole company
         laughs at them, Caliban cannot understand how he has mistaken
         these drunkards for gods.  Before Prospero accompanies the
         group into his cell for the night, he sets Ariel free, but
         instructs him as his last task to furnish calm seas and
         auspicious winds for the voyage to Naples (i).
