              In preparing these synopses, we have tried to remain
         conscious of the following axiom: the best synopsis in the
         world cannot do justice to an artistic masterpiece.  We have
         handled Shakespeare's achievements carefully, and, except
         for some necessary interpretations following the listing of
         certain characters, we have added nothing to Shakespeare's
         own texts. Because Shakespeare's plots contributed to the
         finished product, they are here for inspection. In
         particular, we believe that by dividing the material
         chronologically, the reader can easily locate almost any
         event in the plays.  He will notice, however, that in
         Shakespeare's works, scenes do not necessarily follow a
         chronological sequence, because, on the Elizabethan stage,
         scenes were ordered so that actors could minimize costume
         changes when they were portraying more than one character.
         We have elected to preserve plot continuity for maximum
         interpretation and clarity. The early comedies particularly
         do not lend themselves to any other treatment.
             In conclusion, we should like add this word of caution.
         Synopses cannot replace the works themselves; they should be
         regarded as merely the supporting fabric of a finely crafted
         tapestry masterpiece.
