######Train a text classifier to recognize authors in just a few lines of Python. 

This Python library is used to train a classifier that learns to recognize different authors' writings. The model is built with [minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir)'s [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) and the [Keras](https://keras.io) deep learning library.
